The rights of conscience shall never be infringed.  The State shall make no
law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise
thereof; no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office
of public trust or for any vote at any election; nor shall any person be
incompetent as a witness or juror on account of religious belief or the
absence thereof.  There shall be no union of Church and State, nor shall any
church dominate the State or interfere with its functions.  No public money or
property shall be appropriated for or applied to any religious worship,
exercise or instruction, or for the support of any ecclesiastical
establishment.
