Article XXIV,  Section 9.   [Transfer of probate causes to district courts.]
When the State is admitted into the Union, and the District Courts in the
respective districts are organized, the books, records, papers and proceedings
of the probate court in each county, and all causes and matters of
administration pending therein, upon the expiration of the term of office of
the Probate Judge, on the second Monday in January, 1896, shall pass into the
jurisdiction and possession of the District Court, which shall proceed to
final judgment or decree, order or other determination in the several matters
and causes, as the Territorial Probate Court might have done, if this
Constitution had not been adopted. And until the expiration of the term of
office of the Probate Judges, such Probate Judges shall perform the duties now
imposed upon them by the laws of the Territory. The District Courts shall have
appellate and revisory jurisdiction over the decisions of the Probate Courts
as now provided by law, until such latter courts expire by limitation.
