Article XXIV,  Section 6.   [Criminal prosecutions begun and crimes
committed before statehood.]
All criminal prosecutions, and penal actions, which may have arisen, or which
may arise before the change from a Territorial to a State Government, and
which shall then be pending, shall be prosecuted to judgment and execution in
the name of the State, and in the court having jurisdiction thereof. All
offenses committed against the laws of the Territory of Utah, before the
change from a Territorial to a State Government, and which shall not have been
prosecuted before such change, may be prosecuted in the name, and by authority
of the State of Utah, with like effect as though such change had not taken
place, and all penalties incurred shall remain the same, as if this
Constitution had not been adopted.
