Article XXIII,  Section 1.   [Amendments: proposal, election.]
Any amendment or amendments to this Constitution may be proposed in either
house of the Legislature, and if two-thirds of all the members elected to each
of the two houses, shall vote in favor thereof, such proposed amendment or
amendments shall be entered on their respective journals with the yeas and
nays taken thereon; and the Legislature shall cause the same to be published
in at least one newspaper in every county of the state, where a newspaper is
published, for two months immediately preceding the next general election, at
which time the said amendment or amendments shall be submitted to the electors
of the state for their approval or rejection, and if a majority of the
electors voting thereon shall approve the same, such amendment or amendments
shall become part of this Constitution.
The revision or amendment of an entire article or the addition of a new
article to this Constitution may be proposed as a single amendment and may be
submitted to the electors as a single question or proposition. Such amendment
may relate to one subject, or any number of subjects, and may modify, or
repeal provisions contained in other articles of the Constitution, if such
provisions are germane to the subject matter of the article being revised,
amended or being proposed as a new article.
