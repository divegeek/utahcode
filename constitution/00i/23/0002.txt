Whenever two-thirds of the members, elected to each branch of the Legislature,
shall deem it necessary to call a convention to revise or amend this
Constitution, they shall recommend to the electors to vote, at the next
general election, for or against a convention, and, if a majority of all the
electors, voting at such election, shall vote for a convention, the
Legislature, at its next session, shall provide by law for calling the same.
The convention shall consist of not less than the number of members in both
branches of the Legislature.
