Article VI,  Section 22.   [Reading of bills -- Bill to contain only one
subject -- Bills passed by majority.]
Every bill shall be read by title three separate times in each house except in
cases where two-thirds of the house where such bill is pending suspend this
requirement. Except general appropriation bills and bills for the codification
and general revision of laws, no bill shall be passed containing more than one
subject, which shall be clearly expressed in its title. The vote upon the
final passage of all bills shall be by yeas and nays and entered upon the
respective journals of the house in which the vote occurs. No bill or joint
resolution shall be passed except with the assent of the majority of all the
members elected to each house of the Legislature.
