Article VI,  Section 19.   [Officers liable for impeachment -- Judgment --
Prosecution by law.]
The Governor and other State and Judicial officers shall be liable to
impeachment for high crimes, misdemeanors, or malfeasance in office; but
judgment in such cases shall extend only to removal from office and
disqualification to hold any office of honor, trust, or profit in the State.
The party, whether convicted or acquitted, shall, nevertheless, be liable to
prosecution, trial, and punishment according to law.
