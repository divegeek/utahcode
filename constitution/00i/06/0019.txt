Article VI,  Section 19.   [Officers liable for impeachment -- Judgment --  Prosecution by law.]

The Governor and other State and Judicial officers shall be liable to impeachment for high crimes, misdemeanors, or malfeasance in office; but judgment in such cases shall extend only to removal from office and disqualification to hold any office of honor, trust, or profit in the State.  The party, whether convicted or acquitted, shall, nevertheless, be liable to prosecution, trial, and punishment according to law.
