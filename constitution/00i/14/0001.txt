Article XIV,  Section 1.   [Fixing the limit of the state indebtedness --
Exceptions.]
To meet casual deficits or failures in revenue, and for necessary expenditures
for public purposes, including the erection of public buildings, and for the
payment of all Territorial indebtedness assumed by the State, the State may
contract debts, not exceeding in the aggregate at any one time, an amount
equal to one and one-half per centum of the value of the taxable property of
the State, as shown by the last assessment for State purposes, previous to the
incurring of such indebtedness.  But the State shall never contract any
indebtedness, except as provided in Article XIV, Section 2, in excess of such
amount, and all monies arising from loans herein authorized, shall be applied
solely to the purposes for which they were obtained.
