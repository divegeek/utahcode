Article VIII,  Section 2.   [Supreme court -- Chief justice -- Declaring law
unconstitutional -- Justice unable to participate.]
The Supreme Court shall be the highest court and shall consist of at least
five justices.  The number of justices may be changed by statute, but no
change shall have the effect of removing a justice from office.  A chief
justice shall be selected from among the justices of the Supreme Court as
provided by statute.  The chief justice may resign as chief justice without
resigning from the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court by rule may sit and
render final judgment either en banc or in divisions.  The court shall not
declare any law unconstitutional under this constitution or the Constitution
of the United States, except on the concurrence of a majority of all justices
of the Supreme Court.  If a justice of the Supreme Court is disqualified or
otherwise unable to participate in a cause before the court, the chief
justice, or in the event the chief justice is disqualified or unable to
participate, the remaining justices, shall call an active judge from an
appellate court or the district court to participate in the cause.
