Article VIII,  Section 8.   [Vacancies -- Nominating commissions -- Senate
approval.]
(1)  When a vacancy occurs in a court of record, the governor shall fill the
vacancy by appointment from a list of at least three nominees certified to the
governor by the Judicial Nominating Commission having authority over the
vacancy.  The governor shall fill the vacancy within 30 days after receiving
the list of nominees.  If the governor fails to fill the vacancy within the
time prescribed, the chief justice of the Supreme Court shall within 20 days
make the appointment from the list of nominees.
(2)  The Legislature by statute shall provide for the nominating commissions'
composition and procedures.  No member of the Legislature may serve as a
member of, nor may the Legislature appoint members to, any Judicial Nominating
Commission.
(3)  The Senate shall consider and render a decision on each judicial
appointment within 60 days of the date of appointment.  If necessary, the
Senate shall convene itself in extraordinary session for the purpose of
considering judicial appointments.  The appointment shall be effective upon
approval of a majority of all members of the Senate.  If the Senate fails to
approve the appointment, the office shall be considered vacant and a new
nominating process shall commence.
(4)  Selection of judges shall be based solely upon consideration of fitness
for office without regard to any partisan political consideration.
