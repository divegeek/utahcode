Article VIII,  Section 9.   [Judicial retention elections.]
Each appointee to a court of record shall be subject to an unopposed retention
election at the first general election held more than three years after
appointment.  Following initial voter approval, each Supreme Court justice
every tenth year, and each judge of other courts of record every sixth year,
shall be subject to an unopposed retention election at the corresponding
general election.  Judicial retention elections shall be held on a nonpartisan
ballot in a manner provided by statute.  If geographic divisions are provided
for any court of record, the judges of those courts shall stand for retention
election only in the geographic division to which they are selected.
