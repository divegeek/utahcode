Each appointee to a court of record shall be subject to an unopposed retention election at the first general election held more than three years after appointment.  Following initial voter approval, each Supreme Court justice every tenth year, and each judge of other courts of record every sixth year, shall be subject to an unopposed retention election at the corresponding general election.  Judicial retention elections shall be held on a nonpartisan ballot in a manner provided by statute.  If geographic divisions are provided for any court of record, the judges of those courts shall stand for retention election only in the geographic division to which they are selected.
