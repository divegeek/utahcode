54-8-7.   Reports of utilities -- Recommendations -- Estimate of costs.
The public utility or utilities report shall set forth an estimate of the
total underground conversion costs and shall also indicate the costs of
underground conversion of facilities of the public utility corporations
located within the boundaries of the various parcels or lots then receiving
service. The report shall also contain the public utility corporations'
recommendations concerning the feasibility of the project for the district
proposed in so far as the physical characteristics of the district and the
facilities of the public utilities within the district are concerned. The
report shall make recommendations by the public utility corporations
concerning inclusion or exclusion of areas within the district or immediately
adjacent to the district. The governing body shall give careful consideration
to the public utility corporations' recommendations concerning feasibility,
recognizing their expertise in this area, and may amend the boundaries of the
proposed improvement district provided that the costs and feasibility report
of the public utilities contains a cost figure on the district as amended or
it may request a new costs and feasibility report from the public utilities
concerned on the basis of the amended district. The cost estimate contained in
the report shall not be considered binding on the utilities if construction is
not commenced within six months of the submission of the estimate for reasons
not within the control of the utility. Should such a delay result in a
significant increase of the conversion costs, new hearings shall be held on
the creation of the district. In the event that only a minor increase results,
only the hearing on the assessments need be held again.
