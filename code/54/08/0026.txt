(i)  conversion of all facilities owned within the improvement district by a public utility from overhead to underground to the point of delivery is proceeding;

(ii)  the property owner is responsible for the changes in the service entrance equipment located on the property to accommodate the conversion of the applicable public utility's facilities from overhead to underground at the point of delivery; and

(d)  The public utility or its contractor shall perform the necessary construction to the point of delivery, unless the public utility authorizes another to perform the construction.

(2) (a)  Failure to have the property owner's service entrance equipment described in Subsection (1)(a)(ii) converted to accommodate underground service within the time that the governing body specifies in writing shall be considered as the property owner's consent to and grant of a construction easement to the county or municipality and as express authority to the county or municipality to arrange for qualified persons to enter upon the lot or parcel for the purpose of making the required changes.

(b)  A construction easement under Subsection (2)(a) terminates upon completion of the conversion of overhead facilities to underground.
