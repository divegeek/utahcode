such grades shall be divided between the railroad or street railroad
corporations affected, or between such corporations and the state, county,

demand the establishment, creation or construction of a crossing of a street
or highway over, under or upon the tracks or lines of any public utility, the
department may by order, decision, rule or decree require the establishment,
construction or creation of such crossing, and such crossing shall thereupon
become a public highway and crossing.

any dispute upon petition by any person aggrieved by any action of the
department pursuant to this section, except as provided under Subsection
(4)(b).
