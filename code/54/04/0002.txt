(1)  Whenever the commission believes that in order to secure a compliance
with the provisions of this title or with the orders of the commission, or

should be made of any act or omission to act, or of anything accomplished or
proposed, or of any schedule, classification, rate, price, charge, fare, toll,
rental, rule, regulation, service or facility of any public utility, it shall
investigate the same upon its own motion, and may fix a time and place for a
hearing thereof with notice to the public utility concerning which such
investigation shall be made, and upon such hearing shall make such findings
and orders as shall be just and reasonable with respect to any such matter.
