54-4-23.   Accounts and records of utilities.
The commission shall have power to establish a system of accounts to be kept
by public utilities subject to its jurisdiction, to classify said public
utilities and to establish a system of accounts for each class and to
prescribe the manner in which such accounts shall be kept. It may also, in its
discretion prescribe the forms of accounts, records and memoranda to be kept
by such public utilities, including accounts, records and memoranda of the
movement of traffic as well as of the receipts and expenditures of money, and
any other forms, records and memoranda which in the judgment of the commission
may be necessary to carry out any of the provisions of this title. The system
of accounts established by the commission and the forms of accounts, records
and memoranda prescribed by it shall not be inconsistent, in the case of
corporations subject to the provisions of the Act of Congress entitled, "An
Act to Regulate Commerce," approved February 4, 1887, and the acts amendatory
thereof and supplementary thereto, with the system and forms from time to time
established for such corporations by the Interstate Commerce Commission; but
nothing herein contained shall affect the power of the commission to prescribe
forms of accounts, records and memoranda covering information in addition to
that required by the Interstate Commerce Commission. The commission may, after
hearing had upon its own motion or upon complaint, prescribe by order the
accounts in which particular outlays and receipts shall be entered, charged or
credited. When the commission shall have prescribed the forms of accounts,
records or memoranda to be kept by any public utility corporation for any of
its business it shall thereafter be unlawful for such public utility to keep
any accounts, records or memoranda for such business other than those so
prescribed or those prescribed by or under the authority of any other state or
of the United States, excepting such accounts, records or other memoranda as
shall be explanatory of and supplemental to the accounts, records or memoranda
prescribed by the commission.
