54-4-13.   Joint use of properties by utilities -- Adjustment of costs --
Cable television easement rights.
(1) Whenever the commission shall find that public convenience and necessity
require the use by one public utility of the conduits, subways, tracks, wires,
poles, pipes or other equipment, or any part thereof, on, over or under any
street or highway, belonging to another public utility, and that such use will
not result in irreparable injury to the owner or other users of such conduits,
subways, tracks, wires, poles, pipes or other equipment, or in any substantial
detriment to the service, and that such public utilities have failed to agree
upon such use or the terms and conditions or compensation for the same, the
commission may, by order, direct that such use be permitted, and prescribe a
reasonable compensation and reasonable terms and conditions for the joint use.
If such use is directed, the public utility to whom the use is permitted shall
be liable to the owner or other users of such conduits, subways, tracks,
wires, poles, pipes or other equipment for such damage as may result therefrom
to the property of such owner or other users thereof.
(2)  Whenever a public utility including its successors, assigns, lessees,
licensees and agents, is granted a right-of-way easement to construct,
operate, maintain or remove utility facilities, electric power and other
facilities as it may require upon, over, under and across land or upon, over,
under and across a dedicated public utility strip, and such public utility has
also entered into a pole attachment contract with a cable television company
which has been granted a franchise by a city, county, municipal or other
public authority including the right to use the wires, conduits, cables, or
poles of such public utility, and providing for the attachment or installation
of wires, cables, and other equipment of a cable television company, to
certain poles or in certain conduits of such public utility under controlled
conditions designed to ensure the continued safe operation of the utilities
service and facilities without any additional burden on the grantor's property
then, and in that event, the cable television company, has the right to share
in and enjoy the use of the right-of-way easement, subject to the terms and
conditions provided in the pole attachment contract, and the right-of-way
easement or interest granted the public utility is apportionable to the cable
television company under the following limitations or conditions:
(a)  Consent is secured from the private property owner where the easement is
located except this requirement shall not apply in the case of a dedicated
public utility strip.
(b)  The Public Service Commission determines that under the terms and
conditions of the pole attachment contract the use of the utilities facilities
by the cable television company will not interfere with the primary utility
function or render its facilities unsafe, and that the contract is in the
public interest.
(c)  The right-of-way easement is not restricted to the sole use of the public
utility; provided, that such restriction shall not apply in any easement
granted for the use of a dedicated public utility strip.
(d)  The use contemplated by the cable television company is the same or
similar to that granted the public utility and that such use will not impose
an additional burden upon the servient tenement.
(e)  The use of the easement by the cable television company will not cause
irreparable injury or damage to the grantor's property.
