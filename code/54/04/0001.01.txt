54-4-1.1.   Wholesale electrical cooperative exempt from rate regulation --
Requirements for rate increase.
The commission does not have the authority under the provisions of this title
to regulate, fix, or otherwise approve or establish the rates, fares, tolls,
or charges of a wholesale electrical cooperative. A wholesale electrical
cooperative shall not vary its charges within any type or classification of
service to any member or the public, one from the other, or from schedules of
rates, fares, tolls, or charges which schedules shall be filed at least
annually with the Division of Public Utilities for informational purposes
only. The prohibition of this section applies only to the rates, fares, tolls,
or charges and does not exempt wholesale electrical cooperatives from other
areas of regulation under this title including, but not limited to, regulation
having an indirect effect on rates, fares, tolls, or charges but which does
not constitute an approval or establishment of them.
A wholesale electrical cooperative must, prior to the implementation of any
rate increase after January 1, 1984, hold a public meeting for all its
customers and members. Notice must be mailed at least 10 days prior to the
meeting. In addition, any schedule of new rates or other change that results
in new rates must be approved by the board of directors of the wholesale
electrical cooperative.
