Any requirement or condition in any permit, authorization, approval, exception, or waiver of a local government for a facility that imposes an actual excess cost shall be considered waived if the local government does not pay the public utility for the actual excess cost, except any actual excess costs specified in Subsection 54-14-201(2)(a) or (2)(b), within 30 days before the date construction of the facility should commence in order to avoid a significant risk of impairment of safe, reliable, and adequate service to customers of the public utility.
