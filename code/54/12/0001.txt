54-12-1.   Legislative policy.
(1)  The Legislature declares that in order to promote the more rapid
development of new sources of electrical energy, to maintain the economic
vitality of the state through the continuing production of goods and the
employment of its people, and to promote the efficient utilization and
distribution of energy, it is desirable and necessary to encourage independent
energy producers to competitively develop sources of electric energy not
otherwise available to Utah businesses, residences, and industries served by
electrical corporations, and to remove unnecessary barriers to energy
transactions involving independent energy producers and electrical
corporations.
(2)  It is the policy of this state to encourage the development of
independent and qualifying power production and cogeneration facilities, to
promote a diverse array of economical and permanently sustainable energy
resources in an environmentally acceptable manner, and to conserve our finite
and expensive energy resources and provide for their most efficient and
economic utilization.
