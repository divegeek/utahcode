54-3-3.   Changes by utilities in schedules -- Notice.
Unless the commission otherwise orders, no change shall be made by any public
utility in any rate, fare, toll, rental, charge or classification, or in any
rule, regulation or contract relating to or affecting any rate, toll, fare,
rental, charge, classification or service, or in any privilege or facility,
except after 30 days' notice to the commission and to the public as herein
provided. Such notice shall be given by filing with the commission, and
keeping open for public inspection, new schedules stating plainly the change
or changes to be made in the schedule or schedules then in force, and the time
when the change or changes will go into effect. The commission for good cause
shown may allow changes, without requiring the thirty days' notice herein
provided for, by an order specifying the changes so to be made, the time when
they shall take effect and the manner in which they shall be filed and
published. When any change is proposed in any rate, fare, toll, rental, charge
or classification, or in any form of contract or agreement, or in any rule,
regulation or contract relating to or affecting any rate, toll, fare, rental,
charge, classification or service, or in any privilege or facility, attention
shall be directed to such change on the schedule filed with the commission by
some character to be designated by the commission immediately preceding or
following the item.
