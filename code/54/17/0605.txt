54-17-605.   Recovery of costs for renewable energy activities.
(1)  In accordance with other law, the commission shall include in the retail
electric rates of an electrical corporation whose rates the commission
regulates the state's share of any of the costs listed in Subsection (2) that
are relevant to the proceeding in which the commission is considering the
electrical corporation's rates:
(a)  if the costs are prudently incurred by the electrical corporation in
connection with:
(i)  the acquisition of a renewable energy certificate;
(ii)  the acquisition of qualifying electricity for which a renewable energy
certificate will be issued after the acquisition; and
(iii)  the acquisition, construction, and use of a renewable energy source;
and
(b)  to the extent any qualifying electricity or renewable energy source under
Subsection (1)(a) satisfies the cost-effectiveness criteria of Subsection
54-17-201(2)(c)(ii).
(2)  The following are costs that may be recoverable under Subsection (1):
(a)  a cost of siting, acquisition of property rights, equipment, design,
licensing, permitting, construction, owning, operating, or otherwise acquiring
a renewable energy source and any associated asset, including transmission;
(b)  a cost to acquire qualifying electricity through trade, power purchase,
or other transfer;
(c)  a cost to acquire a bundled or unbundled renewable energy certificate, if
any net revenue from the sale of a renewable energy certificate allocable to
this state is also included in rates;
(d)  a cost to interconnect a renewable energy source to the electrical
corporation's transmission and distribution system;
(e)  a cost associated with using a physical or financial asset to integrate,
firm, or shape a renewable energy source on a firm annual basis to meet a
retail electricity need; and
(f)  any cost associated with transmission and delivery of qualifying
electricity to a retail electricity consumer.
(3) (a)  The commission may allow an electrical corporation to use an
adjustment mechanism or reasonable method other than a rate case under
Sections 54-4-4 and 54-7-12 to allow recovery of costs identified in
Subsection (2).
(b)  If the commission allows the use of an adjustment mechanism, both the
costs and any associated benefit shall be reflected in the mechanism, to the
extent practicable.
(c)  This Subsection (3) creates no presumption for or against the use of an
adjustment mechanism.
(4) (a)  The commission may permit an electrical corporation to include in its
retail electric rates the state's share of costs prudently incurred by the
electrical corporation in connection with a renewable energy source, whether
or not the renewable energy source ultimately becomes operational, including
costs of:
(i)  siting;
(ii)  property acquisition;
(iii)  equipment;
(iv)  design;
(v)  licensing;
(vi)  permitting; and
(vii)  other reasonable items related to the renewable energy source.
(b)  Subsection (4)(a) creates no presumption concerning the prudence or
recoverability of the costs identified.
(c)  To the extent deferral is consistent with other applicable law, the
commission may allow an electrical corporation to defer costs recoverable
under Subsection (4)(a) until the recovery of the deferred costs can be
considered in a rate proceeding or an adjustment mechanism created under
Subsection (3).
(d)  An application to defer costs shall be filed within 60 days after the day
on which the electrical corporation determines that the renewable energy
source project is impaired under generally accepted accounting principles and
will not become operational.
(e)  Notwithstanding the opportunity to defer costs under Subsection (4)(c), a
cost incurred by an electrical corporation for siting, property acquisition,
equipment, design, licensing, and permitting of a renewable energy source that
the electrical corporation proposes to construct shall be included in the
electrical corporation's project costs for the purpose of evaluating the
project's cost-effectiveness.
(f)  A deferred cost under Subsection (4)(a) may not be added to, or otherwise
considered in the evaluation of, the cost of a project proposed by any person
other than the electrical corporation for the purpose of evaluating that
person's proposal.
