54-17-602.   Target amount of qualifying electricity -- Renewable energy
certificate -- Cost-effectiveness -- Cooperatives.
(1) (a)  To the extent that it is cost effective to do so, beginning in 2025
the annual retail electric sales in this state of each electrical corporation
shall consist of qualifying electricity or renewable energy certificates in an
amount equal to at least 20% of adjusted retail electric sales.
(b)  The amount under Subsection (1)(a) is computed based upon adjusted retail
electric sales for the calendar year commencing 36 months before the first day
of the year for which the target calculated under Subsection (1)(a) applies.
(c)  Notwithstanding Subsections (1)(a) and (b), an increase in the annual
target from one year to the next may not exceed the greater of:
(i)  17,500 megawatt-hours; or
(ii)  20% of the prior year's amount under Subsections (1)(a) and (b).
(2) (a)  Cost-effectiveness under Subsection (1) for other than a cooperative
association is determined in comparison to other viable resource options using
the criteria provided by Subsection 54-17-201(2)(c)(ii).
(b)  For an electrical corporation that is a cooperative association, cost-
effectiveness is determined using criteria applicable to the cooperative
association's acquisition of a significant energy resource established by the
cooperative association's board of directors.
(3)  This section does not require an electrical corporation to:
(a)  substitute qualifying electricity for electricity from a generation
source owned or contractually committed, or from a contractual commitment for
a power purchase;
(b)  enter into any additional electric sales commitment or any other
arrangement for the sale or other disposition of electricity that is not
already, or would not be, entered into by the electrical corporation; or
(c)  acquire qualifying electricity in excess of its adjusted retail electric
sales.
(4)  For the purpose of Subsection (1), an electrical corporation may combine
the following:
(a)  qualifying electricity from a renewable energy source owned by the
electrical corporation;
(b)  qualifying electricity acquired by the electrical corporation through
trade, power purchase, or other transfer; and
(c)  a bundled or unbundled renewable energy certificate, including a banked
renewable energy certificate.
(5)  For an electrical corporation whose rates the commission regulates, the
following rules concerning renewable energy certificates apply:
(a)  a banked renewable energy certificate with an older issuance date shall
be used before any other banked renewable energy certificate issued at a later
date is used; and
(b)  the total of all unbundled renewable energy certificates, including
unbundled banked renewable energy certificates, may not exceed 20% of the
amount of the annual target provided for in Subsection (1).
(6)  An electrical corporation that is a cooperative association may count
towards Subsection (1) any of the following:
(a)  electric production allocated to this state from hydroelectric facilities
becoming operational after December 31, 2007 if the facilities are located in
any state in which the cooperative association, or a generation and
transmission cooperative with which the cooperative association has a
contract, provides electric service;
(b)  qualifying electricity generated or acquired or renewable energy
certificates acquired for a program that permits a retail customer to
voluntarily contribute to a renewable energy source; and
(c)  notwithstanding Subsection 54-17-601(7), an unbundled renewable energy
certificate purchased from a renewable energy source located outside the
geographic boundary of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council if the
electricity on which the unbundled renewable energy certificate is based would
be considered qualifying electricity if the renewable energy source was
located within the geographic boundary of the Western Electricity Coordinating
Council.
(7)  The use of the renewable attributes associated with qualifying
electricity to satisfy any federal renewable energy requirement does not
preclude the electricity from being qualifying electricity for the purpose of
this chapter.
