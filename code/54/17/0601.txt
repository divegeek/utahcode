(a)  becomes operational or is retrofitted on or after January 1, 2008; and

(b)  reduces carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere through permanent geological sequestration or through another verifiably permanent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions through the use of technology.

(7)  "Qualifying electricity" means electricity generated on or after January 1, 1995 from a renewable energy source if:

(a) (i)  the renewable energy source is located within the geographic boundary of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council; or

(ii)  the qualifying electricity is delivered to the transmission system of an electrical corporation or a delivery point designated by the electrical corporation for the purpose of subsequent delivery to the electrical corporation; and

(b)  the renewable energy attributes of the electricity are not traded, sold, transferred, or otherwise used to satisfy another state's renewable energy program.

(8)  "Qualifying zero carbon emissions generation":

(a)  means a generation facility located within the geographic boundary of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council that:

(i)  becomes operational on or after January 1, 2008; and

(ii)  does not produce carbon as a byproduct of the generation process;

(b)  includes generation powered by nuclear fuel; and

(c)  does not include renewable energy sources used to satisfy the requirement established under Subsection 54-17-602(1).

(9)  "Renewable energy certificate" means a certificate issued under Section 54-17-603.

(10)  "Renewable energy source" means:

(a)  an electric generation facility or generation capability or upgrade that becomes operational on or after January 1, 1995 that derives its energy from one or more of the following:

(i)  wind energy;

(ii)  solar photovoltaic and solar thermal energy;

(iii)  wave, tidal, and ocean thermal energy;

(iv)  except for combustion of wood that has been treated with chemical preservatives such as creosote, pentachlorophenol or chromated copper arsenate, biomass and biomass byproducts, including:

(D)  dedicated energy crops; and

(E)  landfill gas or biogas produced from organic matter, wastewater, anaerobic digesters, or municipal solid waste;

(v)  geothermal energy located outside the state;

(vi)  waste gas and waste heat capture or recovery whether or not it is renewable, including methane gas from:

(A)  an abandoned coal mine; or

(B)  a coal degassing operation associated with a state-approved mine permit;

(vii)  efficiency upgrades to a hydroelectric facility, without regard to the date upon which the facility became operational, if the upgrades become operational on or after January 1, 1995;
