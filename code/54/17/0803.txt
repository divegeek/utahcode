(b)  the joint ownership agreement requires the qualified utility to recover from contract customers receiving electricity from the renewable energy facility all of the qualified utility's costs associated with its ownership of the renewable energy facility, including administrative, acquisition, operation, and maintenance costs, unless the commission, in an order issued in a separate regulatory proceeding:

(i)  authorizes the qualified utility to recover some of those costs from customers other than contract customers;

(c)  the qualified utility's contract with the owner of the electricity to be sold from the renewable energy facility shall provide that the qualified utility's obligation to purchase electricity under that contract ceases if the contract customer defaults in its obligation to purchase and pay for the electricity under the contract with the qualified utility.

(4)  The right to any environmental attribute associated with a renewable energy facility shall remain the property of the renewable energy facility's owner, except to the extent that a contract to which the owner is a party provides otherwise.
