(2)  A gas corporation or an electrical corporation may file with the commission a complete filing for cost recovery of a major plant addition if the commission has, in accordance with Section 54-7-12, entered a final order in a general rate case proceeding of the gas corporation or electrical corporation within 18 months of the projected in-service date of a major plant addition.

(ii)  The gas corporation or electrical corporation shall have the burden to prove a major plant addition's impacts as described in Subsection (4)(b)(i).

(c)  If the commission has previously issued an order and approved the major plant addition as a significant energy resource under Section 54-17-302 or resource decision under Section 54-17-402, the commission shall presume the prudence of the utility's capital costs up to the projected costs specified in the commission's previous significant energy resource order or resource decision order.
