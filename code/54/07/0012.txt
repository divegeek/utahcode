(iii)  A party or a person may not file a motion described in Subsection (2)(b)(ii) unless the person or party has first filed a motion to intervene with the commission.

(c)  If, in accordance with Subsection (2)(b)(i), the commission issues an order that an application is not a complete filing, the commission shall:

(i)  determine the materiality of an application deficiency; and

(ii) (A)  if the deficiencies are not material, issue an order that the 240-day period described in Subsection (3)(a) shall continue without delay or be suspended and resume when the public utility files the required information; or

(e)  Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (2)(d), (3), or (4), a proposed rate increase or decrease is not effective until after completion of the hearing and issuance of a final order by the commission concerning the proposed increase or decrease.

(ii)  The commission, on its own initiative or in response to an application by a public utility or other party, may, after a hearing, allow any rate increase or decrease proposed by a public utility, or a reasonable part of the rate increase or decrease, to take effect on an interim basis within 45 days after the day on which the request is filed, subject to the commission's right to order a refund or surcharge.

(iii)  The evidence presented in the hearing held pursuant to this Subsection (4) need not encompass all issues that may be considered in a rate case hearing held pursuant to Subsection (2)(d), but shall establish an adequate prima facie showing that the interim rate increase or decrease is justified.

(b)  The commission may, after a hearing, issue a final order before the expiration of 240 days after the day on which the public utility files a complete filing establishing the utility's revenue requirement and fixing the utility's allowable rates before the commission determines the final allocation of the increase or decrease among categories of customers and classes of service.

(c) (i)  If the commission in the commission's final order on a public utility's revenue requirement finds that the interim increase ordered under Subsection (4)(a)(ii) exceeds the increase finally ordered, the commission shall order the public utility to refund the excess to customers.

(ii)  If the commission in the commission's final order on a public utility's revenue requirement finds that the interim decrease ordered under Subsection (4)(a)(ii) exceeds the decrease finally ordered, the commission shall order a surcharge to customers to recover the excess decrease.

(5) (a)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this title, any schedule, classification, practice, or rule filed by a public utility with the commission that does not result in any rate increase shall take effect 30 days after the date of filing or within any lesser time the commission may grant, subject to its authority after a hearing to suspend, alter, or modify that schedule, classification, practice, or rule.

(b)  When the commission suspends a schedule, classification, practice, or rule, the commission shall hold a hearing on the schedule, classification, practice, or rule before issuing its final order.

(c)  For purposes of this Subsection (5), any schedule, classification, practice, or rule that introduces a service or product not previously offered may not result in a rate increase.

(6)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, whenever a public utility files with the commission any schedule, classification, practice, or rule that does not result in an increase in any rate, fare, toll, rental, or charge, the schedule, classification, practice, or rule shall take effect 30 days after the date of filing or at any earlier time the commission may grant, subject to the authority of the commission, after a hearing, to suspend, alter, or modify the schedule, classification, practice, or rule.

(7)  This section does not apply to any rate changes of an electrical or telephone cooperative that meets all of the requirements of this Subsection (7).

(b) (i)  The commission may investigate whether the proposed rate increase is just and reasonable.
