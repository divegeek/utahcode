(e) (i)  The written authorization to change the provider shall be signed by the subscriber and shall contain a clear, conspicuous, and unequivocal request by the subscriber for a change of telecommunications provider.

(ii)  A written authorization is not valid if it is presented to the subscriber for signature in connection with a sweepstakes, game of chance, or any other means prohibited by commission rule.

(iii)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit any person from offering a premium, incentive, or a thing of value to another as consideration for authorizing a change of telecommunications service provider, provided that no element of chance or skill is associated with the offer of the premium, incentive, or thing of value or its receipt.

(5)  A telecommunications corporation or its agents seeking to verify the change authorization shall connect the subscriber to the third-party verifier or arrange for the third-party verifier to call the subscriber to verify the change authorization.

(6)  A third-party verifier that obtains the subscriber's oral verification regarding the change shall record that verification by obtaining appropriate verification data.

(7) (a)  The record verifying a subscriber's change of provider shall be available to the subscriber upon request.

(b)  Information obtained from the subscriber through verification may not be used for any other purpose.

(c)  Any intentional unauthorized release of the information in Subsection (7)(b) is grounds for penalties or other action by the commission or remedies provided by law to the aggrieved subscriber against the telecommunications corporation, third-party verifier, their agents, or their employees who are responsible for the violation.
