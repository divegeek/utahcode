changed or that it is otherwise in the public interest to do so.
(3)  The director may not issue a stop order against an effective registration
statement on the basis of a fact or transaction known to the division when the

effective.
(4)  A person may not be considered to have violated Section 61-1-7 or 61-1-15

director commences the agency action.
