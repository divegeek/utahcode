(5)  The division may permit the omission of an item of information or document from a registration statement.

(6)  In the case of a nonissuer distribution, information may not be required under Subsection (9) or Section 61-1-10 unless it is known to the person filing the registration statement or to the persons on whose behalf the distribution is to be made, or can be furnished by them without unreasonable effort or expense.

(7) (a)  The division may require as a condition of registration by qualification or coordination:

(i)  that security issued within the past three years or to be issued to a promoter for a consideration substantially different from the public offering price, or to a person for a consideration other than cash, be deposited in escrow; and

(ii)  that the proceeds from the sale of the registered security be impounded until the issuer receives a specified amount from the sale of the security either in this state or elsewhere.

(b)  The division may determine the conditions of an escrow or impounding required by this Subsection (7), but it may not reject a depository solely because of location in another state.

(8) (a)  A registration statement is effective for one year from its effective date.

(b)  All outstanding securities of the same class as a registered security are considered to be registered for the purpose of a nonissuer transaction:

(i)  so long as the registration statement is effective; and

(c)  A person filing an amendment shall pay a registration fee as determined under Section 61-1-18.4 with respect to the additional securities proposed to be offered.
