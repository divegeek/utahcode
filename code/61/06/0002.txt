61-6-2.   "Control shares" defined.
(1)  As used in this chapter, "control shares" means shares that except for
this chapter would have voting power with respect to shares of an issuing
public corporation that, when added to all other shares of the issuing public
corporation owned by a person or in respect to which that person may exercise
or direct the exercise of voting power, would entitle that person, immediately
after acquisition of the shares (directly or indirectly, alone or as a part of
a group), to exercise or direct the exercise of the voting power, including
voting power pursuant to a revocable proxy, of the issuing public corporation
in the election of directors within any of the following ranges of voting
power:
(a)  1/5 or more but less than 1/3 of all voting power;
(b)  1/3 or more but less than a majority of all voting power; or
(c)  a majority or more of all voting power.
(2)  Shares entitling a person, immediately after acquisition of the shares
(directly or indirectly, including pursuant to a revocable proxy or as part of
a group), to exercise or direct the exercise of less than 1/5 of all voting
power of the issuing public corporation in the election of directors shall not
be control shares, even if acquired in a control share acquisition.  Shares
cease to be control shares upon their transfer to a person who is not an
affiliate of the transferor or an affiliate or member of a group with which
the applicable control share acquisition was made, except to the extent the
shares become control shares as a result of their acquisition by the
transferee.
