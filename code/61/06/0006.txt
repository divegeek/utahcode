61-6-6.   Optional exemption from this chapter.
A corporation's articles of incorporation or bylaws may provide that this
chapter does not apply to control share acquisitions of shares of the
corporation.  To be effective, any such provision must have been adopted prior
to the control share acquisition.  Absent such a provision, control shares of
an issuing public corporation acquired in a control share acquisition have
only such voting rights as are conferred by Section 61-6-10.
