23-21-2.   Payments in lieu of property taxes on property purchased by
division.
Prior to the purchase of any real property held in private ownership, the
Division of Wildlife Resources shall first submit the proposition to the
county legislative body in a regular open public meeting in the county where
the property is located and shall by contractual agreement with the county
legislative body, approved by the executive director of the Department of
Natural Resources, agree to pay an amount of money in lieu of property taxes
to the county. The division shall, by contractual agreement with the county
legislative body in which any property previously acquired from private
ownership and now owned by the division is located, agree to pay annually an
amount of money in lieu of wildlife resource fine money, previously paid to
the county. Payments provided for in this section will not exceed what the
regularly assessed real property taxes would be if the land had remained in
private ownership; and these payments shall not include any amount for
buildings, installations, fixtures, improvements or personal property located
upon the land or for those acquired, constructed or placed by the division
after it acquires the land.
