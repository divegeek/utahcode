23-21a-2.   Legislative findings and policy.

The legislature of the state of Utah recognizes that the number of breeding sites of the American white pelican has been reduced from in excess of 50 prior to 1932 to only seven major sites in 1976 as a result of the removal of water barriers around breeding sites, loss of food supply, and human disturbance of nesting colonies. The legislature of the state of Utah further recognizes that Gunnison Island in the Great Salt Lake, one of the seven remaining pelican rookeries in North America, produces over 20% of the world's population of the American white pelican, and is the only remaining major pelican rookery that does not have refuge status. It is hereby declared to be the policy of the state of Utah that areas that will support certain threatened life forms shall be preserved for their benefit and for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations of people.
