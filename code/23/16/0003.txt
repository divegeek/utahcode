(iii)  allowing landowners or lessees to designate recipients who may obtain a mitigation permit to take big game animals on the landowner's or lessee's land during a general or special season hunt authorized by the Wildlife Board; or

(iv)  a description of how the division will assess and compensate the landowner or lessee under Section 23-16-4 for damage to cultivated crops, fences, or irrigation equipment.

(e)  The division and the landowner or lessee shall jointly determine the number of animals taken pursuant to Subsection (2)(b)(ii) of which the landowner or lessee may retain possession.

(f)  In determining appropriate remedial action under this Subsection (2), the division shall consider:

(C)  use of mitigation permits; and

(D)  charging for hunter access.

(3)  Any fee for accessing the owner's or lessee's land shall be determined by the landowner or lessee.

(b)  A subsequent request for action provided under Subsection (4)(a) shall be considered to be a new request for purposes of the 72-hour time limit specified in Subsection (2)(a).

(5) (a)  The division may enter into a conservation lease with the owner or lessee of private lands for a fee or other remuneration as compensation for depredation.
