(A)  participation in a cooperative wildlife management unit;

(B)  use of landowner association permits;

(C)  use of mitigation permits; and

(D)  charging for hunter access.

(c)  In determining how to assess and compensate for damages to cultivated crops, the division's determination shall be based on the:

(i)  full replacement value in the local market of the cultivated crops that actually have been or will be damaged or consumed by big game animals; and

(ii)  cost of delivery of a replacement crop to the location of the damaged crop or other location that is not farther from the source of the replacement crop.

(d)  If the claimant and the division are unable to agree on a fair and equitable damage payment, they shall designate a third party, consisting of one or more persons familiar with the crops, fences, or irrigation equipment and the type of game animals doing the damage, to appraise the damage.

(4) (a)  Notwithstanding Section 63J-1-504, the total amount of compensation that may be provided by the division pursuant to this section and the total cost of fencing materials provided by the division to prevent crop damage may not exceed the legislative appropriation for fencing material and compensation for damaged crops, fences, and irrigation equipment.

(b) (i)  Any claim of $1,000 or less may be paid after appraisal of the damage as provided in Subsection (3), unless the claim brings the total amount of claims submitted by the claimant in the fiscal year to an amount in excess of $1,000.

(ii)  Any claim for damage to irrigation equipment may be paid after appraisal of the damage as provided in Subsection (3).

(A)  $1,000 may be paid pursuant to the conditions of this section; and

(5)  The division may deny or limit compensation if the claimant:

(a)  has failed to exercise reasonable care and diligence to avoid the loss or minimize the damage; or
