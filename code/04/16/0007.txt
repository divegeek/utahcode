Warrants.
(1) (a)  The department shall periodically enter public or private premises
from which seeds are distributed, offered, or exposed for sale to sample,
inspect, analyze, and test agricultural, vegetable, flower, or tree and shrub
seeds or seeds for sprouting distributed within this state to determine
compliance with this chapter.
(b)  To perform the duties specified in Subsection (1)(a), the department
shall:
(i)  establish and maintain facilities for testing the purity and germination
of seeds;
(ii)  prescribe by rule uniform methods for sampling and testing seeds; and
(iii)  establish fees for rendering service.
(2)  The department shall prescribe by rule weed seeds and noxious weed seeds
and fix the tolerances permitted for those offensive seeds.
(3)  If a seed sample, upon analysis, fails to comply with this chapter, the
department shall give written notice to that effect to any person who is
distributing, offering, or exposing the seeds for sale.  Nothing in this
chapter, however, shall be construed as requiring the department to refer
minor violations for criminal prosecution or for the institution of
condemnation proceedings if it believes the public interest will best be
served through informal action.
(4)  The department may proceed immediately, if admittance is refused, to
obtain an ex parte warrant from the nearest court of competent jurisdiction to
allow entry upon the premises for the purpose of making inspections and
obtaining samples.
