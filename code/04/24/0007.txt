(1) Application for a recorded brand or mark shall be made to the department
upon forms prescribed and furnished by it. The application shall contain such
information as the commissioner prescribes. No application shall be approved
without payment of the appropriate recording fee. Upon receipt of a proper
application, payment of the recording fee, and recordation of the brand or
mark in the central Brand or Mark Registry of the department, the commissioner
shall issue the applicant a certified copy of recording which entitles the
applicant to the exclusive use of the brand or mark recorded.
(2)  Each recorded brand or mark filed with the central Brand and Mark
Registry shall expire during the calendar year 1980, and during each fifth
year thereafter. The department shall give notice in writing to all persons
who are owners of recorded brands and marks within a reasonable time prior to
the date of expiration of recordation. Brand or mark renewal is effected by
filing an appropriate application with the department together with payment of
the renewal fee. A recorded brand or mark, not timely renewed, shall lapse and
be removed from the central Brand and Mark Registry.
