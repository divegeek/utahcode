Applicability to horses and mules.
(1)  A person may not transport any cattle or calves from a point within a

in Subsection (2), until the cattle or calves have been brand inspected,
unless the department approves their transport subject to brand inspection at
some point designated along the transport route. A brand inspection fee is not
required to be paid upon reinspection of cattle or calves being transported
between districts from a summer or winter range or pasture if the cattle or

shall apply to the department to inspect the brands and marks of the animals
to be moved. The application shall state the time and place where the animals
may be inspected.  Upon receipt of an application for brand inspection, the
department shall conduct the inspection at the time and place specified in the
application or at such other time and place as the department approves.
(2)  Cattle or calves may be transported between brand inspection districts
without brand inspection if they are destined for a livestock market in this
state.
(3)  Horses and mules may move within the state without a brand inspection,
but a brand inspection is required on a change of ownership or to leave this
state.
