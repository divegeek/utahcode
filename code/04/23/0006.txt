4-23-6.   Department to issue licenses and permits -- Department to issue
aircraft use permits -- Reports.
The department is responsible for the issuance of permits and licenses for the
purposes of the federal Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956.  No state agency or
private person shall use any aircraft for the prevention of damage without
first obtaining a use permit from the department.  A state agency which
contemplates the use of aircraft for the protection of agricultural crops,
livestock, poultry, or wildlife shall file an application with the department
for an aircraft use permit to enable the agency to issue licenses to personnel
within the agency charged with the responsibility to protect such resources.
Persons who desire to use privately owned aircraft for the protection of land,
water, crops, wildlife, or livestock may not engage in any such protective
activity without first obtaining an aircraft permit from the department.
Agencies and private persons which obtain aircraft use permits shall file such
reports with the department as it deems necessary in the administration of its
licensing authority.
