4-10-9.   Sale of bedding, upholstered furniture, quilted clothing, or
filling material -- Tag, stamp, or stencil required -- Secondhand material to
bear tag -- Presumption -- Owner's  own material to be tagged.
No wholesaler or retailer shall sell any bedding, upholstered furniture,
quilted clothing, or prefabricated filling material, whether the point of
origin of such article is inside or outside the state, unless it is
appropriately tagged under Section 4-10-7, or unless it is appropriately
stamped or stenciled under Section 4-10-7 or 4-10-8. A retailer who sells used
articles shall attach a secondhand material tag before sale. Possession of an
article by a person who regularly engages in the manufacture, repair,
wholesale, or supply of such articles is presumptive evidence of intent to
sell.
A person who repairs "owner's own material" shall immediately upon its receipt
attach an owner's material tag to the article. The tag shall remain attached
to the article until it is actually in the process of repair and shall be
reattached upon completion of repair.
