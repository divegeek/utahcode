4-4-6.   Retailers exempt from prosecution -- Conditions for exemption.
No retailer is subject to prosecution under this chapter if the retailer can
establish that at the time the eggs were purchased the seller guaranteed that
the eggs conformed to the grade and quality and size and weight stated in the
purchase invoice and that the eggs were labeled for sale by the retailer in
accordance with the purchase invoice; provided, that such guaranty by the
seller does not exempt a retailer from prosecution if the eggs covered by the
guaranty deteriorated to a lower grade or standard through some action or
inaction of the retailer.
