(1)  The department may lock and seal any pump or other dispensing device
which is in violation of this chapter.  If such action is taken, the
department shall post a notice in a conspicuous place on the pump or other
dispensing device stating that the device has been sealed by the department
and that it is unlawful to break or destroy the seal or to mutilate or alter
the notice.
(2)  Any person who is aggrieved by the action of the department may advise
the department that such person intends to remove the balance of the motor
fuel from the tank or other container which contains the sealed fuel.  The
department, within two working days after the receipt of such notice, shall
break the seal or lock for the container to be emptied.

container removed, except after a subsequent written notice of intent to
remove is filed with the department and upon the payment of a service charge
determined by the department pursuant to Subsection 4-2-2(2).  A notice of
intent to remove may be filed on paper or electronically.
