(1)  Each person making application for a license to hold a race meet under this chapter shall file an application with the commission which shall set forth the time, place, and number of days the race meet will continue, and other information the commission may require.

(2)  A person who has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude may not be issued a license to hold a race meet.

At the hearing, the licensee shall be given an opportunity to be heard in opposition to the proposed cancellation.

(5) (a)  Fair boards or fair districts that conduct race meets in connection with regularly scheduled annual fairs shall be exempt from payment of the fees provided in this section, unless they sponsor a race in which the speed indexes are officially recognized under breed requirements.

(b)  All fair boards and fair meets shall be limited to 14 race days, unless otherwise permitted by a unanimous vote of the commission.

(6)  The exemption from the payment of fees under Subsection (5)(a) does not apply to those qualifying for official speed index races.
