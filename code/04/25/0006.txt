(1) A person who finds an estray and who, after giving notice is authorized by the county to maintain and care for it, is entitled to compensation from the owner, or from the county, as the case may be, for the reasonable costs of feeding and maintaining the animal; provided, that the county is liable for such cost only if the owner is not located after diligent search.
