(1) (a)  When an authorized agent of the department finds or has probable cause to believe that any food is adulterated, or so misbranded as to be dangerous or fraudulent within the meaning of this chapter, he shall affix to the food a tag or other appropriate marking, giving notice that:

When the agent has found that food so detained or embargoed is not adulterated or misbranded, the department shall remove the tag or other marking.

(ii)  all costs, fees, and expenses have been paid; and

(iii)  a sufficient bond, conditioned that the food shall be properly labeled and processed, has been executed.

(ii)  the expenses of supervision have been paid.

(4)  If an authorized agent of the department finds in any building or vehicle any perishable food which is unsound, contains any filthy, decomposed, or putrid substance, or may be poisonous, deleterious to health, or otherwise unsafe, the commissioner or his authorized agent shall condemn or destroy the food or render it unsalable as human food.
