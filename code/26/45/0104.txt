insurance as defined in Section 31A-1-301 may not in connection with the offer
or renewal of an insurance product or in the determination of premiums,
coverage, renewal, cancellation, or any other underwriting decision that
pertains directly to the individual or any group of which the individual is a
member that purchases insurance jointly:
(a)  access or otherwise take into consideration private genetic information
about an asymptomatic individual;

asymptomatic individual or his blood relative has taken or refused to take a

not the results of the test, if a claim for payment for the test has been made
against an individual's health insurance policy;
(b)  may request that portion of private genetic information that is necessary
to determine the insurer's obligation to pay for health care services where:

result of a genetic test; and
(ii)  a claim for payment for such services has been made against the
individual's health insurance policy;
(c)  may only store information obtained under this Subsection (2) in
accordance with the provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996; and
(d)  may only use or otherwise disclose the information obtained under this
Subsection (2) in connection with a proceeding to determine the obligation of
an insurer to pay for a genetic test or health care services, provided that,
in accordance with the provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996, the insurer makes a reasonable effort to limit
disclosure to the minimum necessary to carry out the purposes of the
disclosure.
(3) (a)  An insurer may, to the extent permitted by Subsection (2), seek an
order compelling the disclosure of private genetic information held by an

basis for the order; and
(iii)  include such other measures as may be necessary to limit disclosure for
the protection of the individual.

insurer to use information other than private genetic information to take into
account the health status of an individual, group, or population in
determining premiums or making other underwriting decisions.
(5)  Nothing in this section may be construed as requiring an insurer to pay
for genetic testing.
