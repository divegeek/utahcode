26-21-13.5.   Intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded --
Licensing.
(1) (a)  It is the Legislature's intent that developmentally disabled persons
be provided with an environment and surrounding that, as closely as possible,
resembles small community-based, homelike settings, to allow those persons to
have the opportunity, to the maximum extent feasible, to exercise their full
rights and responsibilities as citizens.
(b)  It is the Legislature's purpose, in enacting this section, to provide
assistance and opportunities to enable persons with developmental disabilities
to achieve their maximum potential through increased independence,
productivity, and integration into the community.
(2)  After July 1, 1990, the department may only license intermediate care
beds for the mentally retarded in small health care facilities.
(3)  The department may define by rule "small health care facility" for
purposes of licensure under this section and adopt rules necessary to carry
out the requirements and purposes of this section.
(4)  This section does not apply to the renewal of a license or the licensure
to a new owner of any facility that was licensed on or before July 1, 1990,
and that licensure has been maintained without interruption.
