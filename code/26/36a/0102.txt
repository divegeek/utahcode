26-36a-102.   Legislative findings.
(1)  The Legislature finds that there is an important state purpose to improve
the access of Medicaid patients to quality care in Utah hospitals because of
continuous decreases in state revenues and increases in enrollment under the
Utah Medicaid program.
(2)  The Legislature finds that in order to improve this access to those
persons described in Subsection (1):
(a)  the rates paid to Utah hospitals must be adequate to encourage and
support improved access; and
(b)  adequate funding must be provided to increase the rates paid to Utah
hospitals providing services pursuant to the Utah Medicaid program.
