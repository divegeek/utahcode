(ii)  added to the preferred drug list after this act takes effect; and

(e)  except as prohibited by Subsections 58-17b-606(4) and (5), shall establish the prior authorization requirements established under Subsections (1)(c) and (d) which shall permit a health care provider or the health care provider's agent to obtain a prior authorization override of the preferred drug list through the department's pharmacy prior authorization review process, and which shall:

(i)  provide either telephone or fax approval or denial of the request within 24 hours of the receipt of a request that is submitted during normal business hours of Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.;

(iii)  require the health care provider to provide the department with documentation of the medical need for the preferred drug list override in accordance with criteria established by the department in consultation with the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee.

(2) (a)  For purposes of this Subsection (2):

(i)  "Immunosuppressive drug":

(A)  means a drug that is used in immunosuppressive therapy to inhibit or prevent activity of the immune system to aid the body in preventing the rejection of transplanted organs and tissue; and

(B)  does not include drugs used for the treatment of autoimmune disease or diseases that are most likely of autoimmune origin.

(ii)  "Psychotropic drug" means the following classes of drugs: atypical anti-psychotic, anti-depressants, anti-convulsant/mood stabilizer, anti-anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder stimulants, or sedative/hypnotics.
