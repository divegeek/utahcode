(7)  The division may not find an institutionalized spouse to be ineligible for medical assistance by reason of resources determined under Subsection (5) to be available for the cost of care when:

(a)  the institutionalized spouse has assigned to the state any rights to support from the community spouse;

(b) (i)  except as provided in Subsection (7)(b)(ii), the institutionalized spouse lacks the ability to execute an assignment due to physical or mental impairment;

(9)  When an institutionalized spouse is determined to be eligible for medical assistance, in determining the amount of the spouse's income that is to be applied monthly for the cost of care in the nursing care facility, the division shall deduct from the spouse's monthly income the following amounts in the following order:

(a)  a personal needs allowance, the amount of which is determined by the division;

(b)  a community spouse monthly income allowance, but only to the extent that the income of the institutionalized spouse is made available to, or for the benefit of, the community spouse;

(c)  a family allowance for each family member, equal to at least 1/3 of the amount that the amount described in Subsection (10)(a)(i) exceeds the amount of monthly income of that family member; and

(d)  amounts for incurred expenses for the medical or remedial care for the institutionalized spouse.

(10) (a)  Except as provided in Subsection (10)(b), the division shall establish a minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance for each community spouse which is not less than the sum of:

(b)  A hearing under this subsection regarding the community spouse resource allowance shall be held by the division within 90 days from the date of the request for the hearing.

(c)  If either spouse establishes that the community spouse needs income, above the level otherwise provided by the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance, due to exceptional circumstances resulting in significant financial duress, there shall be substituted, for the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance provided under Subsection (10), an amount adequate to provide additional income as is necessary.

(d)  If either spouse establishes that the community spouse resource allowance, in relation to the amount of income generated by the allowance is inadequate to raise the community spouse's income to the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance, there shall be substituted, for the community spouse resource allowance, an amount adequate to provide a minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance.

(e)  A hearing may be held under this subsection if either the institutionalized spouse or community spouse is dissatisfied with a determination of:

(i)  the community spouse monthly income allowance;

(ii)  the amount of monthly income otherwise available to the community spouse;

(iii)  the computation of the spousal share of resources under Subsection (4);

(iv)  the attribution of resources under Subsection (6); or

(v)  the determination of the community spouse resource allocation.

(12) (a)  An institutionalized spouse may transfer an amount equal to the community spouse resource allowance, but only to the extent the resources of the institutionalized spouse are transferred to or for the sole benefit of the community spouse.

(b)  The transfer under Subsection (12)(a) shall be made as soon as practicable after the date of the initial determination of eligibility, taking into account the time necessary to obtain a court order under Subsection (12)(c).
