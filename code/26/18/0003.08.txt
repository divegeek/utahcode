(1) (a)  The department shall seek to maximize the use of Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program funds for assistance in the purchase of private health insurance coverage for Medicaid-eligible and non-Medicaid-eligible individuals.

(b)  The department's efforts to expand the use of premium assistance shall:

(i)  include, as necessary, seeking federal approval under all Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program premium assistance provisions of federal law, including provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Public Law 111-148;

(ii)  give priority to, but not be limited to, expanding the state's Utah Premium Partnership for Health Insurance Program, including as required under Subsection (2); and

(iii)  encourage the enrollment of all individuals within a household in the same plan, where possible, including enrollment in a plan that allows individuals within the household transitioning out of Medicaid to retain the same network and benefits they had while enrolled in Medicaid.

(c)  Any increase in state costs resulting from an expansion of premium assistance may not exceed offsetting reductions in Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program state costs attributable to the expansion.

(2)  The department shall seek federal approval of an amendment to the state's Utah Premium Partnership for Health Insurance program to adjust the eligibility determination for single adults and parents who have an offer of employer sponsored insurance.  The amendment shall:

(a)  be within existing appropriations for the Utah Premium Partnership for Health Insurance program; and

(b)  provide that adults who are up to 200% of the federal poverty level are eligible for premium subsidies in the Utah Premium Partnership for Health Insurance program.
