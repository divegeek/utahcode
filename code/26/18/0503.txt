(b)  The division may renew Medicaid certification of a nursing care facility program that is not currently certified if:

(i)  since the day on which the program last operated with Medicaid certification:

(ii)  the number of beds granted renewed Medicaid certification does not exceed the number of beds certified at the time the program last operated with Medicaid certification, excluding a period of time where the program operated with temporary certification under Subsection 26-18-504(4).

(2) (a)  The division may issue a Medicaid certification for a new nursing care facility program if a current owner of the Medicaid certified program transfers its ownership of the Medicaid certification to the new nursing care facility program and the new nursing care facility program meets all of the following conditions:

(b)  A nursing care facility program that receives Medicaid certification under the provisions of Subsection (2)(a) does not assume the Medicaid liabilities of the previous nursing care facility program if the new nursing care facility program:

(i)  is not owned in whole or in part by the previous nursing care facility program; or

(ii)  is not a successor in interest of the previous nursing care facility program.

(5) (a)  As provided in Subsection 26-18-502(2)(b), the director shall issue additional Medicaid certification when requested by a nursing care facility or other interested party if there is insufficient bed capacity with current certified programs in a service area.  A determination of insufficient bed capacity shall be based on the nursing care facility or other interested party providing reasonable evidence of an inadequate number of beds in the county or group of counties impacted by the requested Medicaid certification based on:

(i)  current demographics which demonstrate nursing care facility occupancy levels of at least 90% for all existing and proposed facilities within a prospective three-year period;
