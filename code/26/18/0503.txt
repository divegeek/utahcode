26-18-503.   Authorization to renew, transfer, or increase Medicaid
certified programs -- Reimbursement methodology.
(1)  The division may renew Medicaid certification of a certified program if
the program, without lapse in service to Medicaid recipients, has its nursing
care facility program certified by the division at the same physical facility
as long as the licensed and certified bed capacity at the facility has not
been expanded, unless the director has approved additional beds in accordance
with Subsection (5).
(2) (a)  The division may issue a Medicaid certification for a new nursing
care facility program if a current owner of the Medicaid certified program
transfers its ownership of the Medicaid certification to the new nursing care
facility program and the new nursing care facility program meets all of the
following conditions:
(i)  the new nursing care facility program operates at the same physical
facility as the previous Medicaid certified program;
(ii)  the new nursing care facility program gives a written assurance to the
director in accordance with Subsection (4);
(iii)  the new nursing care facility program receives the Medicaid
certification within one year of the date the previously certified program
ceased to provide medical assistance to a Medicaid recipient; and
(iv)  the licensed and certified bed capacity at the facility has not been
expanded, unless the director has approved additional beds in accordance with
Subsection (5).
(b)  A nursing care facility program that receives Medicaid certification
under the provisions of Subsection (2)(a) does not assume the Medicaid
liabilities of the previous nursing care facility program if the new nursing
care facility program:
(i)  is not owned in whole or in part by the previous nursing care facility
program; or
(ii)  is not a successor in interest of the previous nursing care facility
program.
(3)  The division may issue a Medicaid certification to a nursing care
facility program that was previously a certified program but now resides in a
new or renovated physical facility if the nursing care facility program meets
all of the following:

Medicaid certification at the time of closure;
(b)  the new or renovated physical facility is in the same county or within a
five-mile radius of the original physical facility;
(c)  the time between which the certified program ceased to operate in the
original facility and will begin to operate in the new physical facility is
not more than three years;
(d)  if Subsection (3)(c) applies, the certified program notifies the
department within 90 days after ceasing operations in its original facility,
of its intent to retain its Medicaid certification;
(e)  the provider gives written assurance to the director in accordance with
Subsection (4) that no third party has a legitimate claim to operate a
certified program at the previous physical facility; and
(f)  the bed capacity in the physical facility has not been expanded unless
the director has approved additional beds in accordance with Subsection (5).
(4) (a)  The entity requesting Medicaid certification under Subsections (2)
and (3) must give written assurances satisfactory to the director or his
designee that:
(i)  no third party has a legitimate claim to operate the certified program;
(ii)  the requesting entity agrees to defend and indemnify the department
against any claims by a third party who may assert a right to operate the
certified program; and
(iii)  if a third party is found, by final agency action of the department
after exhaustion of all administrative and judicial appeal rights, to be
entitled to operate a certified program at the physical facility the certified
program shall voluntarily comply with Subsection (4)(b).

the third party who prevailed under Subsection (4)(a)(iii).
(5) (a)  As provided in Subsection 26-18-502(2)(b), the director shall issue
additional Medicaid certification when requested by a nursing care facility or
other interested party if there is insufficient bed capacity with current
certified programs in a service area.  A determination of insufficient bed
capacity shall be based on the nursing care facility or other interested party
providing reasonable evidence of an inadequate number of beds in the county or
group of counties impacted by the requested Medicaid certification based on:
(i)  current demographics which demonstrate nursing care facility occupancy
levels of at least 90% for all existing and proposed facilities within a
prospective three-year period;
(ii)  current nursing care facility occupancy levels of 90%; or
(iii)  no other nursing care facility within a 35-mile radius of the nursing
care facility requesting the additional certification.
(b)  In addition to the requirements of Subsection (5)(a), a nursing care
facility program must demonstrate by an independent analysis that the nursing
care facility can financially support itself at an after tax break-even net
income level based on projected occupancy levels.
(c)  When making a determination to certify additional beds or an additional
nursing care facility program under Subsection (5)(a):
(i)  the director shall consider whether the nursing care facility will offer
specialized or unique services that are underserved in a service area;
(ii)  the director shall consider whether any Medicaid certified beds are
subject to a claim by a previous certified program that may reopen under the
provisions of Subsections (2) and (3); and
(iii)  the director may consider how to add additional capacity to the long-
term care delivery system to best meet the needs of Medicaid recipients.
(6)  The department shall adopt administrative rules in accordance with Title
63G, Chapter 3, Utah Administrative Rulemaking Act, to adjust the Medicaid
nursing care facility property reimbursement methodology to:
(a)  beginning July 1, 2008, only pay that portion of the property component
of rates, representing actual bed usage by Medicaid clients as a percentage of
the greater of:
(i)  actual occupancy; or
(ii) (A)  for a nursing care facility other than a facility described in
Subsection (6)(a)(ii)(B), 85% of total bed capacity; or
