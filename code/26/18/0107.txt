26-18-107.   Retrospective and prospective DUR.
(1)  The board, in cooperation with the division, shall include in its state
plan the creation and implementation of a retrospective and prospective DUR
program for Medicaid outpatient drugs to ensure that prescriptions are
appropriate, medically necessary, and not likely to result in adverse medical
outcomes.
(2)  The retrospective and prospective DUR program shall be operated under
guidelines established by the board under Subsections (3) and (4).
(3)  The retrospective DUR program shall be based on guidelines established by
the board, using the mechanized drug claims processing and information
retrieval system to analyze claims data in order to:
(a)  identify patterns of fraud, abuse, gross overuse, and inappropriate or
medically unnecessary care; and
(b)  assess data on drug use against explicit predetermined standards that are
based on the compendia and other sources for the purpose of monitoring:
(i)  therapeutic appropriateness;
(ii)  overutilization or underutilization;
(iii)  therapeutic duplication;
(iv)  drug-disease contraindications;
(v)  drug-drug interactions;
(vi)  incorrect drug dosage or duration of drug treatment; and
(vii)  clinical abuse and misuse.
(4)  The prospective DUR program shall be based on guidelines established by
the board and shall provide that, before a prescription is filled or
delivered, a review will be conducted by the pharmacist at the point of sale
to screen for potential drug therapy problems resulting from:
(a)  therapeutic duplication;
(b)  drug-drug interactions;
(c)  incorrect dosage or duration of treatment;
(d)  drug-allergy interactions; and
(e)  clinical abuse or misuse.
(5)  In conducting the prospective DUR, a pharmacist may not alter the
prescribed outpatient drug therapy without the consent of the prescribing
physician.  This section does not effect the ability of a pharmacist to
substitute a generic equivalent.
