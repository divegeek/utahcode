(1)  Every licensed physician and surgeon attending a pregnant or recently delivered woman for conditions relating to her pregnancy shall take or cause to be taken a sample of blood of the woman at the time of first examination or within 10 days thereafter.  The blood sample shall be submitted to an approved laboratory for a standard serological test for syphilis.  The provisions of this section do not apply to any female who objects thereto on the grounds that she is a bona fide member of a specified, well recognized religious organization whose teachings are contrary to the tests.

The blood sample shall be submitted to an approved laboratory for a standard serological test for syphilis.

(3)  An approved laboratory is a laboratory approved by the department according to its rules governing the approval of laboratories for the purpose of this title.  In submitting the sample to the laboratory the physician shall designate whether it is a prenatal test or a test following recent delivery.

(4)  For the purpose of this chapter, a "standard serological test" means a test for syphilis approved by the department and made at an approved laboratory.

(5)  The laboratory shall transmit a detailed report of the standard serological test, showing the result thereof to the physician.
