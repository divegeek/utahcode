26-6b-7.   Periodic review of individuals under court order.
(1)  At least two weeks prior to the expiration of the designated period of
any court order still in effect, the petitioner shall inform the court that
issued the order that the order is about to expire. The petitioner shall
immediately reexamine the reasons upon which the court's order was based.  If
the petitioner determines that the conditions justifying that order no longer
exist, it shall discharge the individual from involuntary quarantine,
isolation, or treatment and report its action to the court for a termination
of the order. Otherwise, the court shall schedule a hearing prior to the
expiration of its order and proceed under Sections 26-6b-4 through 26-6b-6.
(2)  The petitioner responsible for the care of an individual under a court
order of involuntary quarantine, isolation, or treatment for an indeterminate
period shall at six-month intervals reexamine the reasons upon which the order
of indeterminate duration was based.  If the petitioner determines that the
conditions justifying that the court's order no longer exist, the petitioner
shall discharge the individual from involuntary quarantine, isolation, or
treatment and immediately report its action to the court for a termination of
the order.  If the petitioner determines that the conditions justifying the
involuntary quarantine, isolation, or treatment continue to exist, the
petitioner shall send a written report of those findings to the court.  The
petitioner shall notify the individual and his counsel of record in writing
that the involuntary quarantine, isolation, or treatment will be continued,
the reasons for that decision, and that the individual has the right to a
review hearing by making a request to the court. Upon receiving the request
for a review, the court shall immediately set a hearing date and proceed under
Sections 26-6b-4 through 26-6b-6.
