(b) (i)  The county attorney for the county where the individual or group of individuals reside or are located shall represent the local health department in any proceedings under this chapter.

(ii)  The Office of the Attorney General shall represent the department when the petitioner is the Department of Health in any proceedings under this chapter.

(2)  The petition under Subsection (1) shall be accompanied by:

(a)  written affidavit of the department stating:

(i)  a belief the individual or group of individuals are subject to restriction;

(ii)  a belief that the individual or group of individuals who are subject to restriction are likely to fail to submit to examination, treatment, quarantine, or isolation if not immediately restrained;

(iii)  this failure would pose a threat to the public health; and

(iv)  the personal knowledge of the individual's or group of individuals' condition or the circumstances that lead to that belief; and

(b)  a written statement by a licensed physician indicating the physician finds the individual or group of individuals are subject to restriction.

(3)  The court shall issue an order of restriction requiring the individual or group of individuals to submit to involuntary restriction to protect the public health if the district court finds:
