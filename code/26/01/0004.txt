(iii)  "Expedited application" means an application for a federal grant that meets the criteria established under Subsection (3)(c)(iv).

(iv)  "Federal grant" means a grant from the federal government that could provide funds for local health departments to help them fulfill their duties and responsibilities.

(A)  before the application is submitted, except for an expedited application; and

(B)  for an expedited application, after the application is submitted but before funds from the federal grant for which the application was submitted are disbursed or encumbered.
