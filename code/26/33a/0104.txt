(iv)  detail the types of data needed for the committee's work, the intended data suppliers, and the form in which such data are to be supplied, noting the consideration given to the potential alternative sources and forms of such data and to the estimated cost to the individual suppliers as well as to the department of acquiring these data in the proposed manner; the plan shall reasonably demonstrate that the committee has attempted to maximize cost-effectiveness in the data acquisition approaches selected;

(v)  describe the types and methods of validation to be performed to assure data validity and reliability;

(d)  advise, consult, contract, and cooperate with any corporation, association, or other entity for the collection, analysis, processing, or reporting of health data identified by control number only in accordance with the plan.

(4)  Except for data collection, analysis, and validation functions described in this section, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to authorize or permit the committee to perform regulatory functions which are delegated by law to other agencies of the state or federal governments or to perform quality assurance or medical record audit functions that health care facilities, health care providers, or third party payors are required to conduct to comply with federal or state law.  The committee may not recommend or determine whether a health care provider, health care facility, third party payor, or self-funded employer is in compliance with federal or state laws including federal or state licensure, insurance, reimbursement, tax, malpractice, or quality assurance statutes or common law.

(5)  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require a data supplier to supply health data identifying a patient by name or describing detail on a patient beyond that needed to achieve the approved purposes included in the plan.

(6)  No request for health data shall be made of health care providers and other data suppliers until a plan for the use of such health data has been adopted.

(7)  If a proposed request for health data imposes unreasonable costs on a data supplier, due consideration shall be given by the committee to altering the request.  If the request is not altered, the committee shall pay the costs incurred by the data supplier associated with satisfying the request that are demonstrated by the data supplier to be unreasonable.

(8)  After a plan is adopted as provided in Section 26-33a-106.1, the committee may require any data supplier to submit fee schedules, maximum allowable costs, area prevailing costs, terms of contracts, discounts, fixed reimbursement arrangements, capitations, or other specific arrangements for reimbursement to a health care provider.

(10)  Nothing in Subsection (8) shall prevent the committee from requiring the submission of health data on the reimbursements actually made to health care providers from any source of payment, including consumers.
