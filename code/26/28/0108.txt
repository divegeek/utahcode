(2)  A donor's revocation of an anatomical gift of the donor's body or part under Section 26-28-106 is not a refusal and does not bar another person specified in Section 26-28-104 or 26-28-109 from making an anatomical gift of the donor's body or part under Section 26-28-105 or 26-28-110.

(5)  In the absence of an express, contrary indication by the donor or other person authorized to make an anatomical gift under Section 26-28-104, an anatomical gift of a part is neither a refusal to give another part nor a limitation on the making of an anatomical gift of another part at a later time by the donor or another person.
