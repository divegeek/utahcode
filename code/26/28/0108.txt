(2)  A donor's revocation of an anatomical gift of the donor's body or part under Section 26-28-106 is not a refusal and does not bar another person specified in Section 26-28-104 or 26-28-109 from making an anatomical gift of the donor's body or part under Section 26-28-105 or 26-28-110.

(5)  In the absence of an express, contrary indication by the donor or other person authorized to make an anatomical gift under Section 26-28-104, an anatomical gift of a part is neither a refusal to give another part nor a limitation on the making of an anatomical gift of another part at a later time by the donor or another person.

(6)  In the absence of an express, contrary indication by the donor or other person authorized to make an anatomical gift under Section 26-28-104, an anatomical gift of a part for one or more of the purposes set forth in Section 26-28-104 is not a limitation on the making of an anatomical gift of the part for any of the other purposes by the donor or any other person under Section 26-28-105 or 26-28-110.
