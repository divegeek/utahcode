39-7-118.   Professional liability protection for certain persons ordered to
active duty in the armed forces.
(1)  This section applies to a person who:
(a)  is ordered to military service, other than training; and
(b)  immediately before receiving the order to military service:
(i)  was engaged in the furnishing of health-care services or other services
determined by rule to be professional services; and
(ii)  had in effect a professional liability insurance policy that does not
continue to cover claims filed with respect to the service member during the
period of the service member's active duty unless the premiums are paid for
coverage for that period.
(2)  Coverage of a person referred to in Subsection (1) by a professional
liability insurance policy shall be suspended by the insurance carrier in
accordance with Subsection (3) upon receipt of a written request by the
service member.
(3)  A professional liability insurance carrier:
(a)  may not require that premiums be paid by or on behalf of a service member
for any professional liability insurance coverage suspended pursuant to
Subsection (2); and
(b)  shall refund any amount paid for coverage for the period of the
suspension or, upon the election of the service member, apply the amount for
the payment of any premium becoming due upon the reinstatement of the
coverage.
(4)  A professional liability insurance carrier is not liable with respect to
any claim that is based on professional conduct, including any failure to take
any action in a professional capacity of a person that occurs during a period
of suspension of that person's professional liability insurance under this
section.  For the purposes of the preceding sentence, a claim based upon the
failure of a professional to make adequate provision for patients to be cared
for during the period of the professional's military service is considered an
action or failure to take action before the beginning of the period of
suspension of professional liability insurance under this section, except in a
case in which professional services were provided after the date of the
beginning of the period.
(5) (a)  Professional liability insurance coverage suspended in the case of
any service member pursuant to Subsection (2) shall be reinstated by the
insurance carrier on the date on which the service member transmits to the
insurance carrier a written request for reinstatement.
(b)  The request of a service member for reinstatement shall be effective only
if the service member transmits the request to the insurance carrier within 30
days after the date on which the service member's military service is
terminated.  The insurance carrier shall notify the person of the due date for
payment of the insurance premium.  The premium shall be paid by the person
within 30 days after receipt of the notice.
(6)  The period for which professional liability insurance coverage shall be
reinstated for a service member under this section may not be less than the
balance of the period for which coverage would have continued under the policy
if the coverage had not been suspended.
(7)  An insurance carrier may not increase the amount of the premium charged
for professional liability insurance coverage of any service member for the
minimum period of the reinstatement of coverage required under Subsection (5)
to an amount greater than the amount chargeable for the coverage for the
period before the suspension, except to the extent of any general increase in
the premium amounts charged by that carrier for the same professional
liability coverage for other persons similarly covered by the same insurance
during the period of the suspension.
(8)  This section does not:
(a)  require a suspension of professional liability insurance coverage for any
person who is not a person referred to in Subsection (1) and who is covered by
the same professional liability insurance as a person referred to in
Subsection (1); or
(b)  relieve any person of the obligation to pay premiums for the coverage not
required to be suspended.
(9)  A civil or administrative action for damages on the basis of the alleged
professional negligence or other professional liability of a person whose
professional liability insurance coverage has been suspended under Subsection
(2) shall be stayed until the end of the period of the suspension if:
(a)  the action was commenced during the period or suspension;
(b)  the action is based on an act or omission that occurred before the date
on which the suspension became effective; and
(c)  the suspended professional liability insurance would, except for the
suspension, on its face cover the alleged professional negligence or other
professional liability negligence or other professional liability of the
person.
