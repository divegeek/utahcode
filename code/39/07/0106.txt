(1)  If compliance with the terms of a contract is stayed pursuant to this
chapter, a fine or penalty may not accrue by reason of failure to comply
during the period of the stay.

imposed for nonperformance of an obligation, a court may relieve enforcement
if the service member was in military service when the penalty was incurred
and his ability to pay or perform was materially impaired.
