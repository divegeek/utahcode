(1)  A landlord may not evict or take and hold property of a service member or
the service member's dependents for nonpayment of rent during the period of
military service if the rent on the premises occupied by the service member or
the service member's dependents is less than $2,400 per month unless a court
allows it after application to the court and an order granted in an action or
proceeding affecting the right of possession.
(2)  In any action affecting the right of possession, the court may, on its
own motion, stay the proceedings for not longer than three months, or make any
order the court determines to be reasonable and just under the circumstances,

is not materially affected by reason of the service member's military service.
(3)  When a stay is granted or other order is made by the court, the owner of
the premises shall be entitled, upon application, to relief with respect to

Sections 39-7-114 through 39-7-116 to the extent and for any period as the
court determines to be just and reasonable under the circumstances.
(4)  Any person who knowingly takes part in any eviction or distress otherwise
than as provided in Subsection (1), or attempts to do so, is guilty of a
misdemeanor.
(5)  The governor is empowered to order an allotment of the pay of a service
member in military service in reasonable proportion to discharge the rent of
premises occupied for dwelling purposes by any dependents of the service
member.
