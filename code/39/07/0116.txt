(a)  In the case of an obligation payable under its terms in installments under a contract for the purchase of real estate, or secured by a mortgage or other instrument in the nature of a mortgage upon real estate, a stay of the enforcement of the obligation during the applicant's period of military service and, from the date of termination of the period of military service or from the date of application if made after termination of military service, for a period equal to the period of the remaining life of the installment contract or other instrument plus a period of time equal to the period of military service of the applicant, or any part of the combined period, subject to payment of the balance of principal and accumulated interest due and unpaid at the date of termination of the period of military service or from the date of application, in equal installments during the combined period at the rate of interest on the unpaid balance as is prescribed in the contract, or other instrument evidencing the obligation, for installments paid when due, and subject to any other terms as the court may consider just.

(b)  In the case of any other obligation or liability, a stay of the enforcement during the applicant's period of military service and, from the date of termination of the period of military service or from the date of application if made after termination of the period of military service, for a period of time equal to the period of military service of the applicant or any part of that period, subject to payment of the balance of principal and accumulated interest due and unpaid at the date of termination of the period of military service or the date of application, in equal periodic installments during the extended period at the rate of interest prescribed for the obligation or liability, if paid when due, and subject to other terms the court considers to be reasonable and just.
