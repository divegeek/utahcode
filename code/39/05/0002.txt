BASIC CONSIDERATIONS AND AUXILIARY ACTION

(1)  Since it is probable that the pattern and detail of the machinery for mutual aid among two or more States may differ from that appropriate among other States party to this compact, this instrument contains elements of a broad base common to all States, and nothing contained in it shall preclude any State from entering into supplementary agreements with another State or States.  Any supplementary agreements may comprehend, but shall not be limited to provisions for evacuation and reception of injured and other persons, and the exchange of medical, fire, police, public utility, reconnaissance, welfare, transportation and communications personnel, equipment, and supplies.

Article 7

COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS

Each party State shall provide for the payment of compensation and death benefits to injured members of the civil defense forces of that State and the representatives of deceased members of the forces of that State in case the members sustain injuries or are killed while rendering aid pursuant to this compact, in the same manner and on the same terms as if the injury or death were sustained within that State.

Article 8

CONTRIBUTIONS AND REIMBURSEMENTS

Any party State rendering aid in another State pursuant to this compact shall be reimbursed by the party State receiving aid for any loss or damage to or expense incurred in the operation of any equipment answering a request for aid, and for the cost incurred in connection with the requests; provided that any aiding party State may assume in whole or in part any loss, damage, expense, or other cost, or may loan any equipment or donate any services to the receiving party State without charge or cost; and provided further that any two or more party States may enter into supplementary agreements establishing a different allocation of costs as among those States.  The United States Government may relieve the party States receiving aid from any liability and reimburse the party State supplying civil defense forces for the compensation paid to and the transportation, subsistence, and maintenance expenses of its forces during the time of the rendition of aid or assistance outside the State and may also pay fair and reasonable compensation for the use or utilization of the supplies, materials, equipment, or facilities so utilized or consumed.
