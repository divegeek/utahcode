70A-2-322.   Delivery "ex-ship."
(1)  Unless otherwise agreed a term for delivery of goods "ex-ship" (which
means from the carrying vessel) or in equivalent language is not restricted to
a particular ship and requires delivery from  a ship which has reached a place
at the named port of destination where goods of the kind are usually
discharged.
(2)  Under such a term unless otherwise agreed
(a)  the seller must discharge all liens arising out of the carriage and
furnish the buyer with a direction which puts the carrier under a duty to
deliver the goods; and
(b)  the risk of loss does not pass to the buyer until the goods leave the
ship's tackle or are otherwise properly unloaded.
