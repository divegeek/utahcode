70A-2-326.   Sale on approval and sale or return -- Rights of creditors.
(1)  Unless otherwise agreed, if delivered goods may be returned by the buyer
even though they conform to the contract, the transaction is:
(a)  a "sale on approval" if the goods are delivered primarily for use; and
(b)  a "sale or return" if the goods are delivered primarily for resale.
(2) Goods held on approval are not subject to the claims of the buyer's
creditors until acceptance; goods held on sale or return are subject to such
claims while in the buyer's possession.
(3)  Any "or return" term of a contract for sale is to be treated as a
separate contract for sale within the statute of frauds section of this
chapter (Section 70A-2-201) and as contradicting the sale aspect of the
contract within the provisions of this chapter on parol or extrinsic evidence
(Section 70A-2-202).
