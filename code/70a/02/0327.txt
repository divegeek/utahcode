(1)  Under a sale on approval unless otherwise agreed
(a)  although the goods are identified to the contract the risk of loss and
the title do not pass to the buyer until acceptance; and
(b)  use of the goods consistent with the purpose of trial is not acceptance
but failure seasonably to notify the seller of election to return the goods is
acceptance, and if the goods conform to the contract acceptance of any part is
acceptance of the whole; and
(c)  after due notification of election to return, the return is at the
seller's risk and expense but a merchant buyer must follow any reasonable
instructions.
(2)  Under a sale or return unless otherwise agreed
(a)  the option to return extends to the whole or any commercial unit of the
goods while in substantially their original condition, but must be exercised
seasonably; and
