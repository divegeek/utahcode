(1)  Tender of delivery is a condition to the buyer's duty to accept the goods
and, unless otherwise agreed, to his duty to pay for them. Tender entitles the
seller to acceptance of the goods and to payment according to the contract.

or documents of title, his right as against the seller to retain or dispose of
them is conditional upon his making the payment due.
