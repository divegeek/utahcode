70A-2-505.   Seller's shipment under reservation.
(1)  Where the seller has identified goods to the contract by or before
shipment:
(a)  his procurement of a negotiable bill of lading to his own order or
otherwise reserves in him a security interest in the goods.  His procurement
of the bill to the order of a financing agency or of the buyer indicates in
addition only the seller's expectation of transferring that interest to the
person named; and
(b)  a nonnegotiable bill of lading to himself or his nominee reserves
possession of the goods as security but except in a case of conditional
delivery as provided in Subsection 70A-2-507(2), a nonnegotiable bill of
lading naming the buyer as consignee reserves no security interest even though
the seller retains possession or control of the bill of lading.
(2)  When shipment by the seller with reservation of a security interest is in
violation of the contract for sale, it constitutes an improper contract for
transportation within the preceding section but impairs neither the rights
given to the buyer by shipment and identification of the goods to the contract
nor the seller's powers as a holder of a negotiable document of title.
