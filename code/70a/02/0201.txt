70A-2-201.   Formal requirements -- Statute of frauds.

(1)  Except as otherwise provided in this section a contract for the sale of
goods for the price of $500 or more is not enforceable by way of action or
defense unless there is some writing sufficient to indicate that a contract
for sale has been made between the parties and signed by the party against
whom enforcement is sought or by his authorized agent or broker. A writing is
not insufficient because it omits or incorrectly states a term agreed upon but
the contract is not enforceable under this paragraph beyond the quantity of
goods shown in such writing.
(2)  Between merchants if within a reasonable time a writing in confirmation
of the contract and sufficient against the sender is received and the party
receiving it has reason to know its contents, it satisfies the requirements of
Subsection (1) against such party unless written notice of objection to its
contents is given within ten days after it is received.
(3)  A contract which does not satisfy the requirements of Subsection (1) but
which is valid in other respects is enforceable
(a)  if the goods are to be specially manufactured for the buyer and are not
suitable for sale to others in the ordinary course of the seller's business
and the seller, before notice of repudiation is received and under
circumstances which reasonably indicate that the goods are for the buyer, has
made either a substantial beginning of their manufacture or commitments for
their procurement; or
(b)  if the party against whom enforcement is sought admits in his pleading,
testimony or otherwise in court that a contract for sale was made, but the
contract is not enforceable under this provision beyond the quantity of goods
admitted; or
(c)  with respect to goods for which payment has been made and accepted or
which have been received and accepted (Section 70A-2-606).
