70A-2-702.   Seller's remedies on discovery of buyer's insolvency.

(1)  Where the seller discovers the buyer to be insolvent he may refuse
delivery except for cash including payment for all goods theretofore delivered
under the contract, and stop delivery under this chapter (Section 70A-2-705).
(2)  Where the seller discovers that the buyer has received goods on credit
while insolvent he may reclaim the goods upon demand made within 10 days after
the receipt, but if misrepresentation of solvency has been made to the
particular seller in writing within three months before delivery the ten-day
limitation does not apply. Except as provided in this subsection the seller
may not base a right to reclaim goods on the buyer's fraudulent or innocent
misrepresentation of solvency or of intent to pay.
(3)  The seller's right to reclaim under Subsection (2) is subject to the
rights of a buyer in ordinary course or other good faith purchaser or lien
creditor under this chapter (Section 70A-2-403). Successful reclamation of
goods excludes all other remedies with respect to them.
