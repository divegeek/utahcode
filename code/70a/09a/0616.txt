(a)  "Explanation" means a writing that:
(i)  states the amount of the surplus or deficiency;
(ii)  provides an explanation in accordance with Subsection (3) of how the
secured party calculated the surplus or deficiency;
(iii)  states, if applicable, that future debits, credits, charges, including
additional credit service charges or interest, rebates, and expenses may
affect the amount of the surplus or deficiency; and
(iv)  provides a telephone number or mailing address from which additional
information concerning the transaction is available.
(b)  "Request" means a record:
(i)  authenticated by a debtor or consumer obligor;
(ii)  requesting that the recipient provide an explanation; and
(iii)  sent after disposition of the collateral under Section 70A-9a-610.
(2)  In a consumer-goods transaction in which the debtor is entitled to a
surplus or a consumer obligor is liable for a deficiency under Section 70A-
9a-615, the secured party shall:
(a)  send an explanation to the debtor or consumer obligor, as applicable,
after the disposition and:
(i)  before or when the secured party accounts to the debtor and pays any
surplus or first makes written demand on the consumer obligor after the
disposition for payment of the deficiency; and
(ii)  within 14 days after receipt of a request; or
(b)  in the case of a consumer obligor who is liable for a deficiency, within
14 days after receipt of a request, send to the consumer obligor a record
waiving the secured party's right to a deficiency.
(3) To comply with Subsection (1)(a)(ii), a writing must provide the following
information in the following order:
(a)  the aggregate amount of obligations secured by the security interest
under which the disposition was made, and, if the amount reflects a rebate of
unearned interest or credit service charge, an indication of that fact,
calculated as of a specified date:
(i)  if the secured party takes or receives possession of the collateral after
default, not more than 35 days before the secured party takes or receives
possession; or
(ii)  if the secured party takes or receives possession of the collateral
before default or does not take possession of the collateral, not more than 35
days before the disposition;
(b)  the amount of proceeds of the disposition;
(c)  the aggregate amount of the obligations after deducting the amount of
proceeds;
(d)  the amount, in the aggregate or by type, and types of expenses, including
expenses of retaking, holding, preparing for disposition, processing, and
disposing of the collateral, and attorney's fees secured by the collateral
which are known to the secured party and relate to the current disposition;
(e)  the amount, in the aggregate or by type, and types of credits, including
rebates of interest or credit service charges, to which the obligor is known
to be entitled and which are not reflected in the amount in Subsection (3)(a);
and
(f)  the amount of the surplus or deficiency.
(4)  A particular phrasing of the explanation is not required.  An explanation
complying substantially with the requirements of Subsection (1) is sufficient,
even if it includes minor errors that are not seriously misleading.
(5)  A debtor or consumer obligor is entitled without charge to one response
to a request under this section during any six-month period in which the
secured party did not send to the debtor or consumer obligor an explanation
pursuant to Subsection (2)(a).  The secured party may require payment of a
charge not exceeding $25 for each additional response.
