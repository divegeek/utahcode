party receives an authenticated demand from a debtor, the secured party shall
cause the secured party of record for a financing statement to send to the
debtor a termination statement for the financing statement or file the
termination statement in the filing office if:
(a)  except in the case of a financing statement covering accounts or chattel
paper that has been sold or goods that are the subject of a consignment, there
is no obligation secured by the collateral covered by the financing statement
and no commitment to make an advance, incur an obligation, or otherwise give
value;
(b)  the financing statement covers accounts or chattel paper that has been

70A-9a-522(1), and 70A-9a-525(3), the filing with the filing office of a

the debtor is a transmitting utility also causes the effectiveness of the
financing statement to lapse.
