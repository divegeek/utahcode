70A-9a-337.   Priority of security interests in goods covered by certificate
of title.
If, while a security interest in goods is perfected by any method under the
law of another jurisdiction, this state issues a certificate of title that
does not show that the goods are subject to the security interest or contain a
statement that they may be subject to security interests not shown on the
certificate:
(1)  a buyer of the goods, other than a person in the business of selling
goods of that kind, takes free of the security interest if the buyer gives
value and receives delivery of the goods after issuance of the certificate and
without knowledge of the security interest; and
(2)  the security interest is subordinate to a conflicting security interest
in the goods that attaches, and is perfected under Subsection 70A-9a-311(2),
after issuance of the certificate and without the conflicting secured party's
knowledge of the security interest.
