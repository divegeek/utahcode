The following rules govern priority among conflicting security interests in
the same investment property:

property under Section 70A-9a-106 has priority over a security interest held
by a secured party that does not have control of the investment property.
(2)  Except as otherwise provided in Subsections (3) and (4), conflicting
security interests held by secured parties each of which has control under
Section 70A-9a-106 rank according to priority in time of:
(a)  if the collateral is a security, obtaining control;
(b)  if the collateral is a security entitlement carried in a securities
account and:
(i)  if the secured party obtained control under Subsection 70A-8-105(4)(a),
the secured party's becoming the person for which the securities account is
maintained;
(ii)  if the secured party obtained control under Subsection 70A-8-105(4)(b),
the securities intermediary's agreement to comply with the secured party's
entitlement orders with respect to security entitlements carried or to be
carried in the securities account; or
(iii)  if the secured party obtained control through another person under
Subsection 70A-8-105(4)(c), the time on which priority would be based under
this subsection if the other person were the secured party; or
(c)  if the collateral is a commodity contract carried with a commodity
intermediary, the satisfaction of the requirement for control specified in

entitlement or a securities account maintained with the securities
intermediary has priority over a conflicting security interest held by another
secured party.
(4)  A security interest held by a commodity intermediary in a commodity
contract or a commodity account maintained with the commodity intermediary has
priority over a conflicting security interest held by another secured party.
(5)  A security interest in a certificated security in registered form which
is perfected by taking delivery under Subsection 70A-9a-313(1) and not by
control under Section 70A-9a-314 has priority over a conflicting security
interest perfected by a method other than control.
(6)  Conflicting security interests created by a broker, securities
intermediary, or commodity intermediary which are perfected without control
under Section 70A-9a-106 rank equally.
