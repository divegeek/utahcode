70A-9a-333.   Priority of certain liens arising by operation of law.

(1)  In this section, "possessory lien" means an interest, other than a security interest or an agricultural lien:

(a)  which secures payment or performance of an obligation for services or materials furnished with respect to goods by a person in the ordinary course of the person's business;

(b)  which is created by statute or rule of law in favor of the person; and

(c)  whose effectiveness depends on the person's possession of the goods.

(2)  A possessory lien on goods has priority over a security interest in the goods unless the lien is created by a statute that expressly provides otherwise.
