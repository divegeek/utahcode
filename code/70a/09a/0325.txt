70A-9a-325.   Priority of security interests in transferred collateral.
(1)  Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (2), a security interest
created by a debtor is subordinate to a security interest in the same
collateral created by another person if:
(a)  the debtor acquired the collateral subject to the security interest
created by the other person;
(b)  the security interest created by the other person was perfected when the
debtor acquired the collateral; and
(c)  there is no period thereafter when the security interest is unperfected.
(2)  Subsection (1) subordinates a security interest only if the security
interest:
(a)  otherwise would have priority solely under Subsection 70A-9a-322(1) or
Section 70A-9a-324; or
(b)  arose solely under Subsection 70A-2-711(3) or 70A-2a-508(5).
