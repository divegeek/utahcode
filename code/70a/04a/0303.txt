70A-4a-303.   Erroneous execution of payment order.
(1)  A receiving bank that executes the payment order of the sender by issuing
a payment order in an amount greater than the amount of the sender's order, or
issues a payment order in execution of the sender's order and then issues a
duplicate order, is entitled to payment of the amount of the sender's order in
accordance with Subsection 70A-4a-402(3) if that subsection is otherwise
satisfied.  The bank is entitled to recover from the beneficiary of the
erroneous order the excess payment received to the extent allowed by the law
governing mistake and restitution.
(2) (a)  A receiving bank that executes the payment order of the sender by
issuing a payment order in an amount less than the amount of the sender's
order is entitled to payment of the amount of the sender's order in accordance
with Subsection 70A-4a-402(3) if:
(i)  that subsection is otherwise satisfied; and
(ii)  the bank corrects its mistake by issuing an additional payment order for
the benefit of the beneficiary of the sender's order.
(b)  If the error is not corrected, the issuer of the erroneous order is
entitled to receive or retain payment from the sender of the order it accepted
only to the extent of the amount of the erroneous order.  This subsection does
not apply if the receiving bank executes the sender's payment order by issuing
a payment order in an amount less than the amount of the sender's order for
the purpose of obtaining payment of its charges for services and expenses
pursuant to instruction of the sender.
(3)  If a receiving bank executes the payment order of the sender by issuing a
payment order to a beneficiary different from the beneficiary of the sender's
order and the funds transfer is completed on the basis of that error, the
sender of the payment order that was erroneously executed and all previous
senders in the funds transfer are not obliged to pay the payment orders they
issued.  The issuer of the erroneous order is entitled to recover from the
beneficiary of the order the payment received to the extent allowed by the law
governing mistake and restitution.
