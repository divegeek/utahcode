70A-4-502.   Presentment of "on arrival" drafts.
If a draft or the relevant instructions require presentment "on arrival,"
"when goods arrive" or the like, the collecting bank need not present until in
its judgment a reasonable time for arrival of the goods has expired.  Refusal
to pay or accept because the goods have not arrived is not dishonor; the bank
must notify its transferor of the refusal but need not present the draft again
until it is instructed to do so or learns of the arrival of the goods.
