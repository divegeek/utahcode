70A-4-405.   Death or incompetence of customer.
(1)  A payor or collecting bank's authority to accept, pay or collect an item
or to account for proceeds of its collection, if otherwise effective, is not
rendered ineffective by incompetence of a customer of either bank existing at
the time the item is issued or its collection is undertaken if the bank does
not know of an adjudication of incompetence. Neither death nor incompetence of
a customer revokes the authority to accept, pay, collect, or account until the
bank knows of the fact of death or of an adjudication of incompetence and has
reasonable opportunity to act on it.
(2)  Even with knowledge, a bank may for 10 days after the date of death pay
or certify checks drawn on or before that date unless ordered to stop payment
by a person claiming an interest in the account, and Subsection 70A-4-403(2)
shall not be applicable to the stop payment order of such person.
