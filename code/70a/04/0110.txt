70A-4-110.   Electronic presentment.
(1)  "Agreement for electronic presentment" means an agreement, clearinghouse
rule, or Federal Reserve regulation or operating circular, providing that
presentment of an item may be made by transmission of an image of an item or
information describing the item, a "presentment notice," rather than delivery
of the item itself.  The agreement may provide for procedures governing
retention, presentment, payment, dishonor, and other matters concerning items
subject to the agreement.
(2)  Presentment of an item in accordance with an agreement for presentment is
made when the presentment notice is received.
(3)  If presentment is made by presentment notice, a reference to "item" or
"check" in this chapter means the presentment notice unless the context
otherwise indicates.
