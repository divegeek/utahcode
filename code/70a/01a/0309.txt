70A-1a-309.   Option to accelerate at will.
A term providing that one party or that party's successor in interest may
accelerate payment or performance or require collateral or additional
collateral "at will" or when the party "considers itself insecure," or words
of similar import, means that the party has power to do so only if that party
in good faith believes that the prospect of payment or performance is
impaired.  The burden of establishing lack of good faith is on the party
against which the power has been exercised.
