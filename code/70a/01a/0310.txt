70A-1a-310.   Subordinated obligations.
An obligation may be issued as subordinated to performance of another
obligation of the person obligated, or a creditor may subordinate its right to
performance of an obligation by agreement with either the person obligated or
another creditor of the person obligated.  Subordination does not create a
security interest as against either the common debtor or a subordinated
creditor.
