70A-2a-303.   Transfer of party's interest under lease contract or of
lessor's residual interest in goods -- Transfer as event of default --
Creation or enforcement of security interest -- Transfer of right to damages
for default.
(1)  As used in this section, "creation of a security interest" includes the
sale of a lease contract subject to Title 70A, Chapter 9a, Uniform Commercial
Code -- Secured Transactions, by reason of Subsection 70A-9a-109(1)(c).
(2)  Except as provided in Subsection (3) and Section 70A-9a-407, a provision
in a lease agreement that prohibits the voluntary or involuntary transfer
(including a transfer by sale, sublease, creation or enforcement of a security
interest, or attachment, levy, or other judicial process) of an interest of a
party under the lease contract or of the lessor's residual interest in the
goods, or that makes such a transfer an event of default, gives rise to the
rights and remedies provided in Subsection (4), but a transfer that is
prohibited or is an event of default under the lease agreement is otherwise
effective.
(3)  A provision in a lease agreement that prohibits a transfer of a right to
damages for default with respect to the whole lease contract or of a right to
payment arising out of the transferor's due performance of the transferor's
entire obligation, or makes such a transfer an event of default, is not
enforceable, and such a transfer is not a transfer that materially impairs the
prospect of obtaining return performance by, materially changes the duty of,
or materially increases the burden or risk imposed on, the other party to the
lease contract within the purview of Subsection (4).
(4)  Subject to Subsection (3) and Section 70A-9a-407:
(a)  if a transfer is made that is made an event of default under a lease
agreement, the party to the lease contract not making the transfer, unless
that party waives the default or otherwise agrees, has the rights and remedies
described in Section 70A-2a-501; and
(b)  if Subsection (4)(a) is not applicable and if a transfer is made that is
prohibited under a lease agreement, or materially impairs the prospect of
obtaining return performance by, materially changes the duty of, or materially
increases the burden or risk imposed on, the other party to the lease
contract, unless the party not making the transfer agrees at any time to the
transfer in the lease contract or otherwise, then, except as limited by
contract, the transferor is liable to the party not making the transfer for
damages caused by the transfer to the extent that the damages could not
reasonably be prevented by the party not making the transfer, and a court
having jurisdiction may grant other appropriate relief, including cancellation
of the lease contract or an injunction against the transfer.
(5)  A transfer of "the lease" or of "all my rights under the lease" or a
transfer in similar general terms, is a transfer of rights, and unless the
language or the circumstances, as in a transfer for security, indicate the
contrary, the transfer is a delegation of duties by the transferor to the
transferee.  Acceptance by the transferee constitutes a promise by  the
transferee to perform those duties.   The promise is enforceable by either the
transferor or the other party to the lease contract.
(6)  Unless otherwise agreed by the lessor and the lessee, a delegation of
performance does not relieve the  transferor as against the other party of any
duty to perform or any liability for default.
(7)  In a consumer lease, to prohibit the transfer of an interest of a party
under the lease contract, or to make a transfer an event of default, the
language must be specific, by writing, and conspicuous.
