70A-2a-214.   Exclusion or modification of warranties.
(1)  Words or conduct relevant to the creation of an express warranty and
words or conduct tending to negate or limit a warranty must be construed
wherever reasonable as consistent with each other; but, subject to the
provisions of Section 70A-2a-202 on parol or extrinsic evidence, negation or
limitation is inoperative to the extent that the construction is unreasonable.
(2)  Subject to Subsection (3), to exclude or modify the implied warranty of
merchantability or any part of it the language must mention "merchantability,"
be by a writing, and be conspicuous.  Subject to Subsection (3), to exclude or
modify any implied warranty of fitness the exclusion must be by a writing and
be conspicuous.  Language to exclude all implied warranties of fitness is
sufficient if it is in writing, is conspicuous, and states, for example,
"There is no warranty that the goods will be fit for a particular purpose."
(3)  Notwithstanding Subsection (2), but subject to Subsection (4):
(a)  unless the circumstances indicate otherwise, all implied warranties are
excluded by expressions like "as is," or "with all faults," or by other
language that in common understanding calls the lessee's attention to the
exclusion of warranties and makes plain that there is no implied warranty, if
in writing and conspicuous;
(b)  if the lessee before entering into the lease contract has examined the
goods or the sample or model as fully as desired or has refused to examine the
goods, there is no implied warranty with regard to defects that an examination
ought in the circumstances to have revealed; and
(c)  an implied warranty may also be excluded or modified by course of
dealing, course of performance, or usage of trade.
(4)  To exclude or modify a warranty against interference or against
infringement as provided in Section 70A-2a-211, or any part of the warranty,
the language must be specific, be by a writing, and be conspicuous, unless the
circumstances, including course of performance, course of dealing, or usage of
trade, give the lessee reason to know that the goods are being leased subject
to a claim or interest of any person.
