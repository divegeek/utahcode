70A-2a-504.   Liquidation of damages.
(1)  Damages payable by either party for default, or any other act or
omission, including indemnity for loss or diminution of anticipated tax
benefits or loss or damage to lessor's residual interest, may be liquidated in
the lease agreement, but only at an amount or by a formula that is reasonable
in light of the then anticipated harm caused by the default or other act or
omission.
(2)  If the lease agreement provides for liquidation of damages, and such
provision does not comply with Subsection (1), or such provision is an
exclusive or limited remedy that circumstances cause to fail of its essential
purpose, remedy may be had as provided in this chapter.
(3)  If the lessor justifiably withholds or stops delivery of goods because of
the lessee's default or insolvency as provided in Section 70A-2a-525 or 70A-
2a-526, the lessee is entitled to restitution of any amount by which the sum
of his payments exceeds:
(a)  the amount to which the lessor is entitled by virtue of terms liquidating
the lessor's damages in accordance with Subsection (1); or
(b)  in the absence of those terms, 20 percent of the then present value of
the total rent the lessee was obligated to pay for the balance of the lease
term, or, in the case of a consumer lease, the lesser of such amount or $500.
(4)  A lessee's right to restitution under Subsection (3) is subject to offset
to the extent the lessor establishes:
(a)  a right to recover damages under the provisions of this chapter other
than Subsection (1); and
(b)  the amount or value of any benefits received by the lessee directly or
indirectly by reason of the lease contract.
