70A-2a-202.   Final written expression -- Parol or extrinsic evidence.
Terms with respect to which the confirmatory memoranda of the parties agree or
which are otherwise set forth in a writing intended by the parties as a final
expression of their agreement with respect to such terms as are included
therein may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior agreement or of a
contemporaneous oral agreement, but may be explained or supplemented:
(1)  by course of dealing or usage of trade or by course of performance; and
(2)  by evidence of consistent additional terms unless the court finds the
writing to have been intended also as a complete and exclusive statement of
the terms of the agreement.
