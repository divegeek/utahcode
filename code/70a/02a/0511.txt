70A-2a-511.   Merchant lessee's duties as to rightfully rejected goods.
(1)  Subject to any security interest of a lessee as provided in Subsection
70A-2a-508 (5), if a lessor or a supplier has no agent or place of business at
the market of rejection, a merchant lessee, after rejection of goods in his
possession or control, shall follow any reasonable instructions received from
the lessor or the supplier with respect to the goods.  In the absence of those
instructions, a merchant lessee shall make reasonable efforts to sell, lease,
or otherwise dispose of the goods for the lessor's account if they threaten to
decline in value speedily.  Instructions are not reasonable if on demand
indemnity for expenses is not forthcoming.
(2)  If a merchant lessee under Subsection (1) or any other lessee under
Section 70A-2a-512 disposes of goods, he is entitled to reimbursement either
from the lessor or the supplier or out of the proceeds for reasonable expenses
of caring for and disposing of the goods and, if the expenses include no
disposition commission, to such commission as is usual in the trade, or if
there is none, to a reasonable sum not exceeding 10% of the gross proceeds.
(3)  In complying with this section or Section 70A-2a-512, the lessee is held
only to good faith.  Good faith conduct hereunder is neither acceptance or
conversion nor the basis of an action for damages.
(4)  A purchaser who purchases in good faith from a lessee pursuant to this
section or Section 70A-2a-512 takes the goods free of any rights of the lessor
and the supplier even though the lessee fails to comply with one or more of
the requirements of this chapter.
