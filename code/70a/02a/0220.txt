70A-2a-220.   Effect of default on risk of loss.
(1)  Where risk of loss is to pass to the lessee and the time of passage is
not stated:
(a)  If a tender or delivery of goods so fails to conform to the lease
contract as to give a right of rejection, the risk of their loss remains with
the lessor, or, in the case of a finance lease, the supplier, until cure or
acceptance.
(b)  If the lessee rightfully revokes acceptance, he, to the extent of any
deficiency in his effective insurance coverage, may treat the risk of loss as
having remained with the lessor from the beginning.
(2)  Whether or not risk of loss is to pass to the lessee, if the lessee as to
conforming goods already identified to a lease contract repudiates or is
otherwise in default under the lease contract, the lessor, or, in the case of
a finance lease, the supplier, to the extent of any deficiency in his
effective insurance coverage may treat the risk of loss as resting on the
lessee for a commercially reasonable time.
