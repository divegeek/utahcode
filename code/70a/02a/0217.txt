70A-2a-217.   Identification.
Identification of goods as goods to which a lease contract refers may be made
at any time and in any manner explicitly agreed to by the parties.  In the
absence of explicit agreement, identification occurs:
(1)  when the lease contract is made if the lease contract is for a lease of
goods that are existing and identified;
(2)  when the goods are shipped, marked, or otherwise designated by the lessor
as goods to which the lease contract refers if the lease contract is for a
lease of goods that are not existing and identified; or
(3)  when the young are conceived if the lease contract is for a lease of
unborn young of animals.
