70A-2a-308.   Special rights of creditors.
(1)  A creditor of a lessor in possession of goods subject to a lease contract
may treat the lease contract as void if as against the creditor retention of
possession by the lessor is fraudulent or voids the lease contract under any
statute or rule of law, but retention of possession in good faith and current
course of trade by the lessor for a commercially reasonable time after the
lease contract becomes enforceable is not fraudulent and does not void the
lease contract.
(2)  Nothing in this chapter impairs the rights of creditors of a lessor if
the lease contract is made under circumstances which under any statute or rule
of law apart from the chapter would constitute the transaction a fraudulent
transfer or voidable preference.
(3)  A creditor of a seller may treat a sale or an identification of goods to
a contract for sale as void if as against the creditor retention of possession
by the seller is fraudulent under any statute or rule of law, but retention of
possession of the goods pursuant to a lease contract entered into by the
seller as lessee and the buyer as lessor in connection with the sale or
identification of the goods is not fraudulent if the buyer bought for value
and in good faith.
