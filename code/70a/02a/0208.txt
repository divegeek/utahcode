70A-2a-208.   Modification, rescission, and waiver.
(1)  An agreement modifying a lease contract needs no consideration to be
binding.
(2)  A signed lease agreement that excludes modification or rescission except
by a signed writing may not be otherwise modified or rescinded.
(3)  Although an attempt at modification or rescission does not satisfy the
requirements of Subsection (2), it may operate as a waiver.
(4)  A party who has made a waiver affecting an executory portion of a lease
contract may retract the waiver by reasonable notification received by the
other party that strict performance will be required of any term waived,
unless the retraction would be unjust in view of a material change of position
in reliance on the waiver.
