70A-7a-502.   Rights acquired by due negotiation.
(1)  Subject to Sections 70A-7a-205 and 70A-7a-503, a holder to which a
negotiable document of title has been duly negotiated acquires thereby:
(a)  title to the document;
(b)  title to the goods;
(c)  all rights accruing under the law of agency or estoppel, including rights
to goods delivered to the bailee after the document was issued; and
(d)  the direct obligation of the issuer to hold or deliver the goods
according to the terms of the document free of any defense or claim by the
issuer except those arising under the terms of the document or under this
chapter, but in the case of a delivery order, the bailee's obligation accrues
only upon the bailee's acceptance of the delivery order and the obligation
acquired by the holder is that the issuer and any indorser will procure the
acceptance of the bailee.
(2)  Subject to Section 70A-7a-503, title and rights acquired by due
negotiation are not defeated by any stoppage of the goods represented by the
document of title or by surrender of the goods by the bailee and are not
impaired even if:
(a)  the due negotiation or any prior due negotiation constituted a breach of
duty;
(b)  any person has been deprived of possession of a negotiable tangible
document or control of a negotiable electronic document by misrepresentation,
fraud, accident, mistake, duress, loss, theft, or conversion; or
(c)  a previous sale or other transfer of the goods or document has been made
to a third person.
