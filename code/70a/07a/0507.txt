70A-7a-507.   Warranties on negotiation or delivery of document of title.
If a person negotiates or delivers a document of title for value, otherwise
than as a mere intermediary under Section 70A-7a-508, unless otherwise agreed,
the transferor, in addition to any warranty made in selling or leasing the
goods, warrants to its immediate purchaser only that:
(1)  the document is genuine;
(2)  the transferor does not have knowledge of any fact that would impair the
document's validity or worth; and
(3)  the negotiation or delivery is rightful and fully effective with respect
to the title to the document and the goods it represents.
