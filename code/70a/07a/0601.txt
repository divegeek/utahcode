70A-7a-601.   Lost, stolen, or destroyed documents of title.
(1)  If a document of title is lost, stolen, or destroyed, a court may order
delivery of the goods or issuance of a substitute document and the bailee may
without liability to any person comply with the order.  If the document was
negotiable, a court may not order delivery of the goods or issuance of a
substitute document without the claimant's posting security unless it finds
that any person that may suffer loss as a result of nonsurrender of possession
or control of the document is adequately protected against the loss.  If the
document was nonnegotiable, the court may require security.  The court may
also order payment of the bailee's reasonable costs and attorney's fees in any
action under this Subsection (1).
(2)  A bailee that, without a court order, delivers goods to a person claiming
under a missing negotiable document of title is liable to any person injured
thereby.  If the delivery is not in good faith, the bailee is liable for
conversion.  Delivery in good faith is not conversion if the claimant posts
security with the bailee in an amount at least double the value of the goods
at the time of posting to indemnify any person injured by the delivery which
files a notice of claim within one year after the delivery.
