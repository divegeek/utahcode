70A-7a-106.   Control of electronic document of title.
(1)  A person has control of an electronic document of title if a system
employed for evidencing the transfer of interests in the electronic document
reliably establishes that person as the person to which the electronic
document was issued or transferred.
(2)  A system satisfies Subsection (1), and a person is considered to have
control of an electronic document of title, if the document is created,
stored, and assigned in such a manner that:
(a)  a single authoritative copy of the document exists which is unique,
identifiable, and, except as otherwise provided in Subsections (2)(d), (e),
and (f), unalterable;
(b)  the authoritative copy identifies the person asserting control as:
(i)  the person to which the document was issued; or
(ii)  if the authoritative copy indicates that the document has been
transferred, the person to which the document was most recently transferred;
(c)  the authoritative copy is communicated to and maintained by the person
asserting control or its designated custodian;
(d)  copies or amendments that add or change an identified assignee of the
authoritative copy can be made only with the consent of the person asserting
control;
(e)  each copy of the authoritative copy and any copy of a copy is readily
identifiable as a copy that is not the authoritative copy; and
(f)  any amendment of the authoritative copy is readily identifiable as
authorized or unauthorized.
