70A-8-210.   Overissue.
(1)  In this section, "overissue" means the issue of securities in excess of
the amount the issuer has corporate power to issue, but an overissue does not
occur if appropriate action has cured the overissue.
(2)  Except as otherwise provided in Subsections (3) and (4), the provisions
of this chapter which validate a security or compel its issue or reissue do
not apply to the extent that validation, issue, or reissue would result in
overissue.
(3)  If an identical security not constituting an overissue is reasonably
available for purchase, a person entitled to issue or validation may compel
the issuer to purchase the security and deliver it if certificated or register
its transfer if uncertificated, against surrender of any security certificate
the person holds.
(4)  If a security is not reasonably available for purchase, a person entitled
to issue or validation may recover from the issuer the price the person or the
last purchaser for value paid for it with interest from the date of the
person's demand.
