70A-8-403.    Demand that issuer not register transfer.
(1)  A person who is an appropriate person to make an indorsement or originate
an instruction may demand that the issuer not register transfer of a security
by communicating to the issuer a notification that identifies the registered
owner and the issue of which the security is a part and provides an address
for communications directed to the person making the demand.  The demand is
effective only if it is received by the issuer at a time and in a manner
affording the issuer reasonable opportunity to act on it.
(2)  If a certificated security in registered form is presented to an issuer
with a request to register transfer or an instruction is presented to an
issuer with a request to register transfer of an uncertificated security after
a demand that the issuer not register transfer has become effective, the
issuer shall promptly communicate to:
(a)  the person who initiated the demand at the address provided in the
demand; and
(b)  the person who presented the security for registration of transfer or
initiated the instruction requesting registration of transfer a notification
stating that:
(i)  the certificated security has been presented for registration of transfer
or the instruction for registration of transfer of the uncertificated security
has been received;
(ii)  a demand that the issuer not register transfer had previously been
received; and
(iii)  the issuer will withhold registration of transfer for a period of time
stated in the notification in order to provide the person who initiated the
demand an opportunity to obtain legal process or an indemnity bond.
(3)  The period described in Subsection (2)(b)(iii) may not exceed 30 days
after the date of communication of the notification.  A shorter period may be
specified by the issuer if it is not manifestly unreasonable.
(4)  An issuer is not liable to a person who initiated a demand that the
issuer not register transfer for any loss the person suffers as a result of
registration of a transfer pursuant to an effective indorsement or instruction
if the person who initiated the demand does not, within the time stated in the
issuer's communication, either:
(a)  obtain an appropriate restraining order, injunction, or other process
from a court of competent jurisdiction enjoining the issuer from registering
the transfer; or
(b)  file with the issuer an indemnity bond, sufficient in the issuer's
judgment to protect the issuer and any transfer agent, registrar, or other
agent of the issuer involved from any loss it or they may suffer by refusing
to register the transfer.
(5)  This section does not relieve an issuer from liability for registering
transfer pursuant to an indorsement or instruction that was not effective.
