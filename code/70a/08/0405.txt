(1)  If an owner of a certificated security, whether in registered or bearer form, claims that the certificate has been lost, destroyed, or wrongfully taken, the issuer shall issue a new certificate if the owner:

(b)  files with the issuer a sufficient indemnity bond; and

(c)  satisfies other reasonable requirements imposed by the issuer.

(2) (a)  If, after the issue of a new certificate, a protected purchaser of the original certificate presents it for registration of transfer, the issuer shall register the transfer unless an overissue would result.

(b)  If an overissue would result from registration of transfer, the issuer's liability is governed by Section 70A-8-210.

(c)  In addition to any rights on the indemnity bond, an issuer may recover the new certificate from a person to whom it was issued or any person taking under that person, except a protected purchaser.
