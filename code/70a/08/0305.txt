70A-8-305.    Instruction.
(1)  If an instruction has been originated by an appropriate person but is
incomplete in any other respect, any person may complete it as authorized and
the issuer may rely on it as completed, even though it has been completed
incorrectly.
(2)  Unless otherwise agreed, a person initiating an instruction assumes only
the obligations imposed by Section 70A-8-107 and not an obligation that the
security will be honored by the issuer.
