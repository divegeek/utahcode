70A-10-104.   Laws not repealed.
Chapter 7a, Uniform Commercial Code - Documents of Title, does not repeal or
modify any laws prescribing the form or contents of documents of title or the
services or facilities to be afforded by bailees, or otherwise regulating
bailees' businesses in respects not specifically dealt with herein; but the
fact that such laws are violated does not affect the status of a document of
title which otherwise complies with the definition of a document of title as
defined in Section 70A-1a-201.
