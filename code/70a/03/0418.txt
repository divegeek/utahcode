70A-3-418.   Payment or acceptance by mistake.
(1)  Except as provided in Subsection (3), if the drawee of a draft pays or
accepts the draft and the drawee acted on the mistaken belief that payment of
the draft had not been stopped pursuant to Section 70A-4-403, or the signature
of the drawer of the draft was authorized, the drawee may recover the amount
of the draft from the person to whom or for whose benefit payment was made or,
in the case of acceptance, may revoke the acceptance.  Rights of the drawee
under this subsection are not affected by failure of the drawee to exercise
ordinary care in paying or accepting the draft.
(2)  Except as provided in Subsection (3), if an instrument has been paid or
accepted by mistake and the case is not covered by Subsection (1), the person
paying or accepting may, to the extent permitted by the law governing mistake
and restitution, recover the payment from the person to whom or for whose
benefit payment was made, or in the case of acceptance, may revoke the
acceptance.
(3)  The remedies provided by Subsection (1) or (2) may not be asserted
against a person who took the instrument in good faith and for value or who in
good faith changed position in reliance on the payment or acceptance.  This
subsection does not limit remedies provided by Section 70A-3-417 or 70A-4-407.
(4)  Notwithstanding Section 70A-4-215, if an instrument is paid or accepted
by mistake and the payor or acceptor recovers payment or revokes acceptance
under Subsection (1) or (2), the instrument is deemed not to have been paid or
accepted and is treated as dishonored, and the person from whom payment is
recovered has rights as a person entitled to enforce the dishonored
instrument.
