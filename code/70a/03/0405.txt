70A-3-405.   Employer's responsibility for fraudulent indorsement by
employee.
(1)  In this section:
(a)  "Employee" includes an independent contractor and employee of an
independent contractor retained by the employer.
(b)  "Fraudulent indorsement" means in the case of an instrument payable to
the employer, a forged indorsement purporting to be that of the employer, or
in the case of an instrument with respect to which the employer is the issuer,
a forged indorsement purporting to be that of the person identified as payee.
(c) (i)  "Responsibility" with respect to instruments means authority to sign
or indorse instruments on behalf of the employer, to process instruments
received by the employer for bookkeeping purposes, for deposit to an account,
or for other disposition, to prepare or process instruments for issue in the
name of the employer, to supply information determining the names or addresses
of payees of instruments to be issued in the name of the employer, to control
the disposition of instruments to be issued in the name of the employer, or to
act otherwise with respect to instruments in a responsible capacity.
(ii)  "Responsibility" does not include authority that merely allows an
employee to have access to instruments or blank or incomplete instrument forms
that are being stored or transported or are part of incoming or outgoing mail,
or similar access.
(2)  For the purpose of determining the rights and liabilities of a person
who, in good faith, pays an instrument or takes it for value or for
collection, if an employer entrusted an employee with responsibility with
respect to the instrument and the employee or a person acting in concert with
the employee makes a fraudulent indorsement of the instrument, the indorsement
is effective as the indorsement of the person to whom the instrument is
payable if it is made in the name of that person.  If the person paying the
instrument or taking it for value or for collection fails to exercise ordinary
care in paying or taking the instrument and that failure substantially
contributes to loss resulting from the fraud, the person bearing the loss may
recover from the person failing to exercise ordinary care to the extent the
failure to exercise ordinary care contributed to the loss.
(3)  Under Subsection (2), an indorsement is made in the name of the person to
whom an instrument is payable if it is made in a name substantially similar to
the name of that person, or the instrument, whether or not indorsed, is
deposited in a depositary bank to an account in a name substantially similar
to the name of that person.
