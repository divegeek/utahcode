70A-3-117.   Other agreements affecting instrument.
Subject to applicable law regarding exclusion of proof of contemporaneous or
previous agreements, the obligation of a party to an instrument to pay the
instrument may be modified, supplemented, or nullified by a separate agreement
of the obligor and a person entitled to enforce the instrument, if the
instrument is issued or the obligation is incurred in reliance on the
agreement or as part of the same transaction giving rise to the agreement.  To
the extent an obligation is modified, supplemented, or nullified by an
agreement under this section, the agreement is a defense to the obligation.
