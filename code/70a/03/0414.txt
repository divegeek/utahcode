70A-3-414.   Obligation of drawer.
(1)  This section does not apply to cashier's checks or other drafts drawn on
the drawer.
(2)  If an unaccepted draft is dishonored, the drawer is obliged to pay the
draft according to its terms at the time it was issued or, if not issued, at
the time it first came into possession of a holder, or if the drawer signed an
incomplete instrument, according to its terms when completed, to the extent
stated in Sections 70A-3-115 and 70A-3-407.  The obligation is owed to a
person entitled to enforce the draft or to an indorser who paid the draft
under Section 70A-3-415.
(3)  If a draft is accepted by a bank, the drawer is discharged, regardless of
when or by whom acceptance was obtained.
(4)  If a draft is accepted and the acceptor is not a bank, the obligation of
the drawer to pay the draft if the draft is dishonored by the acceptor is the
same as the obligation of an indorser under Subsections 70A-3-415(1) and (3).
(5)  If a draft states that it is drawn "without recourse" or otherwise
disclaims liability of the drawer to pay the draft, the drawer is not liable
under Subsection (2) to pay the draft if the draft is not a check. A
disclaimer of the liability stated in Subsection (2) is not effective if the
draft is a check.
(6)  If a check is not presented for payment or given to a depositary bank for
collection within 30 days after its date, the drawee suspends payments after
expiration of the 30-day period without paying the check, and because of the
suspension of payments, the drawer is deprived of funds maintained with the
drawee to cover payment of the check, the drawer to the extent deprived of
funds may discharge its obligation to pay the check by assigning to the person
entitled to enforce the check the rights of the drawer against the drawee with
respect to the funds.
