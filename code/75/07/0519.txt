75-7-519.   Encumbered assets.
(1)  If any assets of the deceased settlor's estate are encumbered by
mortgage, pledge, lien, or other security interest, the trustee may pay the
encumbrance or any part thereof, renew or extend any obligation secured by the
encumbrance, or convey or transfer the assets to the creditor in satisfaction
of his lien, in whole or in part, whether or not the holder of the encumbrance
has presented a claim, if it appears to be in the best interest of the
deceased settlor's estate.
(2)  Payment of an encumbrance does not increase the share of the beneficiary
entitled to the encumbered assets unless the beneficiary is entitled to
exoneration or unless the terms of the deceased settlor's trust, under which
the beneficiary is entitled to the encumbered assets, provides otherwise.
