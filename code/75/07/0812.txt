(1)  Notwithstanding the breadth of discretion granted to a trustee in the terms of the trust, including the use of such terms as "absolute," "sole," or "uncontrolled," the trustee shall exercise a discretionary power in good faith and in accordance with the terms and purposes of the trust and the interests of the beneficiaries.

(2)  Subject to Subsection (4), and unless the terms of the trust expressly indicate that a rule in this section does not apply:

(a)  a person other than a settlor who is a beneficiary and trustee of a trust that confers on the trustee a power to make discretionary distributions to or for the trustee's personal benefit may exercise the power only in accordance with an ascertainable standard relating to the trustee's individual health, education, support, or maintenance within the meaning of Subsection 2041(b)(1)(A) or 2514(c)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as in effect on May 1, 2004; and

If the power of all trustees is so limited or prohibited, the court may appoint a special fiduciary with authority to exercise the power.

(a)  a power held by the settlor's spouse who is the trustee of a trust for which a marital deduction, as defined in Subsection 2056(b)(5) or 2523(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as in effect on May 1, 2004, was previously allowed;

(b)  any trust during any period that the trust may be revoked or amended by its settlor; or

(c)  a trust if contributions to the trust qualify for the annual exclusion under Subsection 2503(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as in effect on May 1, 2004.
