(2)  Subject to Subsection (4), and unless the terms of the trust expressly indicate that a rule in this section does not apply:

(a)  a person other than a settlor who is a beneficiary and trustee of a trust that confers on the trustee a power to make discretionary distributions to or for the trustee's personal benefit may exercise the power only in accordance with an ascertainable standard relating to the trustee's individual health, education, support, or maintenance within the meaning of Subsection 2041(b)(1)(A) or 2514(c)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as in effect on May 1, 2004; and
