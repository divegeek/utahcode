75-7-415.   Reformation to correct mistakes.
The court may reform the terms of a trust, even if unambiguous, to conform the
terms to the settlor's intention if it is proved by clear and convincing
evidence that both the settlor's intent and the terms of the trust were
affected by a mistake of fact or law, whether in expression or inducement.
