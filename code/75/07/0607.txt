75-7-607.   Limitation on action contesting validity of revocable trust --
Distribution of trust property.
(1)  A person shall commence a judicial proceeding to contest the validity of
a trust that was revocable at the settlor's death within the earlier of:
(a)  three years after the settlor's death; or
(b)  90 days after the trustee sent the person a copy of the trust instrument
and a notice informing the person of the trust's existence, of the trustee's
name and address, and of the time allowed for commencing a proceeding.
(2)  Upon the death of the settlor of a trust that was revocable at the
settlor's death, the trustee may proceed to distribute the trust property in
accordance with the terms of the trust.  The trustee is not subject to
liability for doing so unless:
(a)  the trustee knows of a pending judicial proceeding contesting the
validity of the trust; or
(b)  a potential contestant has notified the trustee of a possible judicial
proceeding to contest the trust and a judicial proceeding is commenced within
60 days after the contestant sent the notification.
(3)  With respect to a potential contest, the trustee is only liable for
actions taken two or more business days after the trustee has actual receipt
of written notice from a potential contestant.  The written notice shall
include the name of the settlor or of the trust, the name of the potential
contestant, and a description of the basis for the potential contest.  The
written notice shall be mailed to the trustee at the principal place of
administration of the trust by registered or certified mail, return receipt
requested, or served upon the trustee in the same manner as a summons in a
civil action.  Any other form or service of notice is not sufficient to impose
liability on the trustee for actions taken pursuant to the terms of the trust.
(4)  A beneficiary of a trust that is determined to have been invalid is
liable to return any distribution received.
