(b)  the transaction was approved by the court;

(c)  the beneficiary did not commence a judicial proceeding within the time allowed by Section 75-7-1005;

(e)  the transaction involves a contract entered into or claim acquired by the trustee before the person became or contemplated becoming trustee.

(3)  A sale, encumbrance, or other transaction involving the investment or management of trust property is presumed to be affected by a conflict between personal and fiduciary interests if it is entered into by the trustee with:

(b)  the trustee's descendants, siblings, parents, or their spouses;

(c)  an agent of the trustee, including but not limited to an attorney, accountant, or financial advisor; or

(d)  a corporation or other person or enterprise in which the trustee, or a person that owns a significant interest in the trustee, has an interest that might affect the trustee's best judgment.

(4)  A transaction between a trustee and a beneficiary that does not concern trust property but that occurs during the existence of the trust or while the trustee retains significant influence over the beneficiary and from which the trustee obtains an advantage is voidable by the beneficiary unless the trustee establishes that the transaction was fair to the beneficiary.

(5)  A transaction not concerning trust property in which the trustee engages in the trustee's individual capacity involves a conflict between personal and fiduciary interests if the transaction concerns an opportunity properly belonging to the trust.

(6)  An investment by a trustee in securities of an investment company or investment trust to which the trustee, or its affiliate, provides services in a capacity other than as trustee is not presumed to be affected by a conflict between personal and fiduciary interests if the investment complies with the prudent investor rule of Section 75-7-901.  The trustee may be compensated by the investment company or investment trust for providing those services out of fees charged to the trust.

(7)  In voting shares of stock or in exercising powers of control over similar interests in other forms of enterprise, the trustee shall act in the best interests of the beneficiaries.

(j)  employing persons, including attorneys, auditors, investment advisers, or agents, even if they are associated with the trustee:

(i)  to advise or assist the trustee in the performance of the trustee's administrative duties or perform any act of administration, whether or not discretionary; or

(ii)  to act without independent investigation upon their recommendations;

(k)  if a governing instrument or order requires or authorizes investment in United States government obligations, investing in those obligations, either directly or in the form of securities or other interests, in any open-end or closed-end management type investment company or investment trust registered under the provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. Sections 80a-1 through 80a-64 if:

(i)  the portfolio of the investment company or investment trust is limited to United States government obligations, and repurchase agreements are fully collateralized by United States government obligations; and
