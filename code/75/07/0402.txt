(1)  A trust is created only if:
(a)  the settlor has capacity to create a trust, which standard of capacity
shall be the same as for a person to create a will;
(b)  the settlor indicates an intention to create the trust or a statute,
judgment, or decree authorizes the creation of a trust;
(c)  the trust has a definite beneficiary or is:
(i)  a charitable trust;
(ii)  a trust for the care of an animal, as provided in Section 75-2-1001; or
(iii)  a trust for a noncharitable purpose, as provided in Section 75-2-1001;
(d)  the trustee has duties to perform; and
(e)  the same person is not the sole trustee and sole beneficiary.
(2)  A beneficiary is definite if the beneficiary can be ascertained now or in
the future, subject to any applicable rule against perpetuities.
(3)  A power in a trustee to select a beneficiary from an indefinite class is
valid.  If the power is not exercised within a reasonable time, the power
fails and the property subject to the power passes to the persons who would
have taken the property had the power not been conferred.
