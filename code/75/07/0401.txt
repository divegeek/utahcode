75-7-401.   Methods of creating trust.
(1)  A trust may be created by:
(a)  transfer of property to another person as trustee during the settlor's
lifetime or by will or other disposition taking effect upon the settlor's
death;
(b)  declaration by the owner of property that the owner holds identifiable
property as trustee; or
(c)  exercise of a power of appointment in favor of a trustee.
(2)  A health savings account is established on the first day an individual is
covered by a high deductible health plan, as defined in Section 223 of the
Internal Revenue Code.  The health savings account shall be opened with a
trustee or custodian within the time prescribed by law, without extensions,
for filing a federal income tax return for that year.  A health savings
account is established regardless of a transfer of cash or other property to
the account and, unless required by the trustee or custodian, it is not
necessary for any party to sign a health savings account trust or custodial
agreement regarding the health savings account.
