75-7-510.   Manner of presentation of claims.
(1)  Claims against a deceased settlor's estate or inter vivos revocable trust
shall be presented as follows:
(a)  The claimant may deliver or mail to the trustee, or the trustee's
attorney of record, a written statement of the claim indicating its basis, the
name and address of the claimant, and the amount claimed.  The claim is
considered presented upon the receipt of the written statement of claim by the
trustee or the trustee's attorney of record.  If a claim is not yet due, the
date when it will become due shall be stated.  If the claim is contingent or
unliquidated, the nature of the uncertainty shall be stated.  If the claim is
secured, the security shall be described.  Failure to describe correctly the
security, the nature of any uncertainty, and the due date of a claim not yet
due does not invalidate the presentation made.
(b)  The claimant may commence a proceeding against the trustee in any court
where the trustee may be subjected to jurisdiction to obtain payment of the
claim against the deceased settlor's estate or the trust estate, but the
commencement of the proceeding must occur within the time limited for
presenting the claim.  No presentation of claim is required in regard to
matters claimed in proceedings against the deceased settlor which were pending
at the time of the deceased settlor's death.
(2)  If a claim is presented under Subsection (1)(a), no proceeding thereon
may be commenced more than 60 days after the trustee has mailed a notice of
disallowance; but, in the case of a claim which is not presently due or which
is contingent or unliquidated, the trustee may consent to an extension of the
60-day period, or to avoid injustice, the court, on petition, may order an
extension of the 60-day period, but in no event may the extension run beyond
the applicable statute of limitations.
