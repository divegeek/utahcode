75-7-1010.   Limitation on personal liability of trustee.
(1)  Except as otherwise provided in the contract, a trustee is not personally
liable on a contract properly entered into in the trustee's fiduciary capacity
in the course of administering the trust if the trustee in the contract
disclosed the fiduciary capacity.
(2)  A trustee is personally liable for torts committed in the course of
administering a trust, or for obligations arising from ownership or control of
trust property, including liability for violation of environmental law, only
if the trustee is personally at fault.
(3)  A claim based on a contract entered into by a trustee in the trustee's
fiduciary capacity, on an obligation arising from ownership or control of
trust property, or on a tort committed in the course of administering a trust,
may be asserted in a judicial proceeding against the trustee in the trustee's
fiduciary capacity, whether or not the trustee is personally liable for the
claim.
(4)  The question of liability as between the trust estate and the trustee
individually may be determined in a proceeding for accounting, surcharge, or
indemnification or other appropriate proceeding.
(5)  Whenever an instrument creating a trust reserves to the settlor, or vests
in an advisory or investment committee, or in any other person or persons,
including one or more cotrustees to the exclusion of the trustee or to the
exclusion of one or more of several trustees, authority to direct the making
or retention of any investment, the excluded trustee or trustees shall not be
liable, either individually or as a fiduciary, for any loss resulting from the
making or retention of any investment pursuant to such direction.
(6)  In the absence of actual knowledge or information which would cause a
reasonable trustee to inquire further, no trustee shall be liable for failure
to take necessary steps to compel the redress of any breach of trust or
fiduciary duty by any predecessor personal representative, trustee, or other
fiduciary.  The provisions of this section shall not be construed to limit the
fiduciary liability of any trustee for his own acts or omissions with respect
to the trust estate.
