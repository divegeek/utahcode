75-7-501.   Rights of beneficiary's creditor or assignee.
To the extent a beneficiary's interest is not protected by a spendthrift
provision or Section 25-6-14, the court may authorize a creditor or assignee
of the beneficiary to reach the beneficiary's interest by attachment of
present or future distributions to or for the benefit of the beneficiary or
other means.  The court may limit the award to relief as is appropriate under
the circumstances.
