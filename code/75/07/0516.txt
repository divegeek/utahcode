75-7-516.   Counterclaims.
(1)  In allowing a claim, the trustee may deduct any counterclaim which the
deceased settlor's estate has against the claimant.  In determining a claim
against a deceased settlor's estate, a court shall reduce the amount allowed
by the amount of any counterclaims and, if the counterclaims exceed the claim,
render a judgment against the claimant in the amount of the excess.
(2)  A counterclaim, liquidated or unliquidated, may arise from a transaction
other than that upon which the claim is based.
(3)  A counterclaim may give rise to relief exceeding in amount or different
in kind from that sought in the claim.
