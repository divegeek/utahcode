75-7-413.   Cy pres.

(1)  Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (2), if a particular charitable purpose becomes unlawful, impracticable, impossible to achieve, or wasteful:

(a)  the trust does not fail, in whole or in part;

(b)  the trust property does not revert to the settlor or the settlor's successors in interest; and

(c)  the court may apply cy pres to modify or terminate the trust by directing that the trust property be applied or distributed, in whole or in part, in a manner consistent with the settlor's charitable purposes.

(2)  A provision in the terms of a charitable trust that would result in distribution of the trust property to a noncharitable beneficiary prevails over the power of the court under Subsection (1) to apply cy pres to modify or terminate the trust only if, when the provision takes effect:

(a)  the trust property is to revert to the settlor and the settlor is still living; or

(b)  fewer than 21 years have elapsed since the date of the trust's creation.
