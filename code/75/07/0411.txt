75-7-411.   Modification or termination of noncharitable irrevocable trust
by consent.
(1)  A noncharitable, irrevocable trust may be modified or terminated upon
consent of the settlor and all beneficiaries, even if the modification or
termination is inconsistent with a material purpose of the trust.  A settlor's
power to consent to a trust's termination may be exercised by an agent under a
power of attorney only to the extent expressly authorized by the power of
attorney or the terms of the trust, by the settlor's conservator with the
approval of the court supervising the conservatorship if an agent is not so
authorized, or by the settlor's guardian with the approval of the court
supervising the guardianship if an agent is not so authorized and a
conservator has not been appointed.
(2)  A noncharitable, irrevocable trust may be terminated upon consent of all
of the beneficiaries if the court concludes that continuance of the trust is
not necessary to achieve any material purpose of the trust.  A noncharitable,
irrevocable trust may be modified upon consent of all of the beneficiaries if
the court concludes that modification is not inconsistent with a material
purpose of the trust.
(3)  A spendthrift provision in the terms of the trust is not presumed to
constitute a material purpose of the trust.
(4)  Upon termination of a trust under Subsection (1) or (2), the trustee
shall distribute the trust property as agreed by the beneficiaries.
(5)  If not all of the beneficiaries consent to a proposed modification or
termination of the trust under Subsection (1) or (2), the modification or
termination may be approved by the court if the court is satisfied that:
(a)  if all of the beneficiaries had consented, the trust could have been
modified or terminated under this section; and
(b)  the interests of a beneficiary who does not consent will be adequately
protected.
