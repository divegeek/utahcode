75-5a-123.   Effect on existing custodianships.
(1)  Any transfer of custodial property as now defined in this part made
before July 1, 1990, is validated notwithstanding that there was no specific
authority in the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act for the coverage of custodial
property of that kind or for a transfer from that source at the time the
transfer was made.
(2)  This part applies to all transfers made before July 1, 1990, in a manner
and form prescribed in the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act, except as the
application impairs constitutionally vested rights or extends the duration of
custodianships in existence on July 1, 1990.
(3)  Sections 75-5a-102 and 75-5a-121 regarding the age of a minor for whom
custodial property is held under this part do not apply to custodial property
held in a custodianship that terminated because of the minor's attainment of
the age of majority and before July 1, 1990.
