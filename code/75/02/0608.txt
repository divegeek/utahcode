75-2-608.   Exercise of power of appointment.

In the absence of a requirement that a power of appointment be exercised by a reference, or by an express or specific reference, to the power, a general residuary clause in a will, or a will making general disposition of all of the testator's property, expresses an intention to exercise a power of appointment held by the testator only if:

(1)  the power is a general power and the creating instrument does not contain a gift if the power is not exercised; or

(2)  the testator's will manifests an intention to include the property subject to the power.
