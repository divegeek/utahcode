75-2-702.   Requirement of survival by 120 hours -- Under probate code or
governing instrument -- Co-owners -- Exceptions -- Protection of payors, third
parties, and bona fide purchasers -- Personal liability of recipient.
(1)  Except as provided in Subsection (4), an individual who is not
established by clear and convincing evidence to have survived an event,
including the death of another individual, by 120 hours is considered to have
predeceased the event.
(2)  Except as provided in Subsection (4), for purposes of a provision of a
governing instrument that relates to an individual surviving an event,
including the death of another individual, an individual who is not
established by clear and convincing evidence to have survived the event by 120
hours is considered to have predeceased the event.
(3)  Except as provided in Subsection (4), if:
(a)  it is not established by clear and convincing evidence that one of two
co-owners with right of survivorship survived the other co-owner by 120 hours,
1/2 of the property passes as if one had survived by 120 hours and 1/2 as if
the other had survived by 120 hours; and
(b)  there are more than two co-owners and it is not established by clear and
convincing evidence that at least one of them survived the others by 120
hours, the property passes in the proportion that one bears to the whole
number of co-owners.  For the purposes of this subsection, "co-owners with
right of survivorship" includes joint tenants, tenants by the entireties, and
other co-owners of property or accounts held under circumstances that entitles
one or more to the whole of the property or account on the death of the other
or others.
(4)  Survival by 120 hours is not required if:
(a)  the governing instrument contains language dealing explicitly with
simultaneous deaths or deaths in a common disaster and that language is
operable under the facts of the case;
(b)  the governing instrument expressly indicates that an individual is not
required to survive an event, including the death of another individual, by
any specified period or expressly requires the individual to survive the event
by a specified period; but survival of the event or the specified period shall
be established by clear and convincing evidence;
(c)  the imposition of a 120-hour requirement of survival would cause a
nonvested property interest or a power of appointment to fail to qualify for
validity under Section 75-2-1203 or to become invalid under Section 75-2-1203;
but survival shall be established by clear and convincing evidence;  or
(d)  the application of a 120-hour requirement of survival to multiple
governing instruments would result in an unintended failure or duplication of
a disposition; but survival shall be established by clear and convincing
evidence.
(5) (a)  A payor or other third party is not liable for having made a payment
or transferred an item of property or any other benefit to a beneficiary
designated in a governing instrument who, under this section, is not entitled
to the payment or item of property, or for having taken any other action in
good faith reliance on the beneficiary's apparent entitlement under the terms
of the governing instrument, before the payor or other third party received
written notice of a claimed lack of entitlement under this section.  A payor
or other third party is liable for a payment made or other action taken after
the payor or other third party received written notice of a claimed lack of
entitlement under this section.
(b)  Written notice of a claimed lack of entitlement under Subsection (5)(a)
shall be mailed to the payor's or other third party's main office or home by
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or served upon the
payor or other third party in the same manner as a summons in a civil action.
Upon receipt of written notice of a claimed lack of entitlement under this
section, a payor or other third party may pay any amount owed or transfer or
deposit any item of property held by it to or with the court having
jurisdiction of the probate proceedings relating to the decedent's estate, or
if no proceedings have been commenced, to or with the court having
jurisdiction of probate proceedings relating to the decedent's estates located
in the county of the decedent's residence.  The court shall hold the funds or
item of property and, upon its determination under this section, shall order
disbursement in accordance with the determination.  Payments, transfers, or
deposits made to or with the court discharge the payor or other third party
from all claims for the value of amounts paid to or items of property
transferred to or deposited with the court.
(6) (a)  A person who purchases property for value and without notice, or who
receives a payment or other item of property in partial or full satisfaction
of a legally enforceable obligation, is neither obligated under this section
to return the payment, item of property, or benefit nor is liable under this
section for the amount of the payment or the value of the item of property or
benefit.  But a person who, not for value, receives a payment, item of
property, or any other benefit to which the person is not entitled under this
section is obligated to return the payment, item of property, or benefit, or
is personally liable for the amount of the payment or the value of the item of
property or benefit, to the person who is entitled to it under this section.
(b)  If this section or any part of this section is preempted by federal law
with respect to a payment, an item of property, or any other benefit covered
by this section, a person who, not for value, receives the payment, item of
property, or any other benefit to which the person is not entitled under this
section is obligated to return the payment, item of property, or benefit, or
is personally liable for the amount of the payment or the value of the item of
property or benefit, to the person who would have been entitled to it were
this section or part of this section not preempted.
