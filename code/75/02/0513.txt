75-2-513.   Separate writing identifying devise of certain types of tangible
personal property.
Whether or not the provisions relating to holographic wills apply, a will may
refer to a written statement or list to dispose of items of tangible personal
property not otherwise specifically disposed of by the will, other than money.
To be admissible under this section as evidence of the intended disposition,
the writing shall be signed by the testator and shall describe the items and
the devisees with reasonable certainty.  The writing may be referred to as one
to be in existence at the time of the testator's death;  it may be prepared
before or after the execution of the will;  it may be altered by the testator
after its preparation;  and it may be a writing that has no significance apart
from its effect on the dispositions made by the will.
