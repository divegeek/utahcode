(2)  If the sum of the amounts described in Subsection 75-2-209(1), and that part of the elective-share amount payable from the decedent's probate estate and nonprobate transfers to others under Subsections 75-2-209(2) and (3) is less than $75,000, the surviving spouse is entitled to a supplemental elective-share amount equal to $75,000, minus the sum of the amounts described in those sections.

(4)  The right, if any, of the surviving spouse of a decedent who dies domiciled outside Utah to take an elective share in property in Utah is governed by the law of the decedent's domicile at death.
