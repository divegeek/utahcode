(1)  A specific devisee has a right to the specifically devised property in
the testator's estate at death and:
(a)  any balance of the purchase price, together with any security agreement,
owing from a purchaser to the testator at death by reason of sale of the

recovery for injury to the property;
(d)  property owned by the testator at death and acquired as a result of
foreclosure, or obtained in lieu of foreclosure, of the security interest for
a specifically devised obligation;
(e)  real or tangible personal property owned by the testator at death which
the testator acquired as a replacement for specifically devised real or
tangible personal property; and
(f)  unless the facts and circumstances indicate that ademption of the devise
was intended by the testator or ademption of the devise is consistent with the
testator's manifested plan of distribution, the value of the specifically
devised property to the extent the specifically devised property is not in the
testator's estate at death and its value or its replacement is not covered by
Subsections (1)(a) through (e).
(2)  If specifically devised property is sold or mortgaged by a conservator or
by an agent acting within the authority of a durable power of attorney for an
incapacitated principal, or if a condemnation award, insurance proceeds, or
recovery for injury to the property are paid to a conservator or to an agent
acting within the authority of a durable power of attorney for an
incapacitated principal, the specific devisee has the right to a general
pecuniary devise equal to the net sale price, the amount of the unpaid loan,
the condemnation award, the insurance proceeds, or the recovery.
(3)  The right of a specific devisee under Subsection (2) is reduced by any
right the devisee has under Subsection (1).
(4)  For the purposes of the references in Subsection (2) to a conservator,
Subsection (2) does not apply if after the sale, mortgage, condemnation,
casualty, or recovery, it was adjudicated that the testator's incapacity
ceased and the testator survived the adjudication by one year.
(5)  For the purposes of the references in Subsection (2) to an agent acting
within the authority of a durable power of attorney for an incapacitated
principal:
(a)  "incapacitated principal" means a principal who is an incapacitated
person;
(b)  no adjudication of incapacity before death is necessary; and
(c)  the acts of an agent within the authority of a durable power of attorney
are presumed to be for an incapacitated principal.
