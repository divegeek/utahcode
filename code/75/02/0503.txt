75-2-503.   Writings intended as wills.
Although a document or writing added upon a document was not executed in
compliance with Section 75-2-502, the document or writing is treated as if it
had been executed in compliance with that section if the proponent of the
document or writing establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the
decedent intended the document or writing to constitute:
(1)  the decedent's will;
(2)  a partial or complete revocation of the will;
(3)  an addition to or an alteration of the will; or
(4)  a partial or complete revival of his formerly revoked will or of a
formerly revoked portion of the will.
