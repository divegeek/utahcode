75-2-213.   Waiver of right to elect and of other rights.
(1)  The right of election of a surviving spouse and the rights of the
surviving spouse to homestead allowance, exempt property, and family
allowance, or any of them, may be waived, wholly or partially, before or after
marriage, by a written contract, agreement, or waiver signed by the surviving
spouse.
(2)  A surviving spouse's waiver is not enforceable if the surviving spouse
proves that:
(a)  he did not execute the waiver voluntarily;  or
(b)  the waiver was unconscionable when it was executed and, before execution
of the waiver, he:
(i)  was not provided a fair and reasonable disclosure of the property or
financial obligations of the decedent;
(ii)  did not voluntarily and expressly waive, in writing, any right to
disclosure of the property or financial obligations of the decedent beyond the
disclosure provided;  and
(iii)  did not have, or reasonably could not have had, an adequate knowledge
of the property or financial obligations of the decedent.
(3)  An issue of unconscionability of a waiver is for decision by the court as
a matter of law.
(4)  Unless it provides to the contrary, a waiver of "all rights," or
equivalent language, in the property or estate of a present or prospective
spouse or a complete property settlement entered into after or in anticipation
of separation or divorce is a waiver of all rights of elective share,
homestead allowance, exempt property, and family allowance by each spouse in
the property of the other and a renunciation by each of all benefits that
would otherwise pass to him from the other by intestate succession or by
virtue of any will executed before the waiver or property settlement.
