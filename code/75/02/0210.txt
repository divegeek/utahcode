75-2-210.   Personal liability of recipients.
(1)  Only original recipients of the decedent's nonprobate transfers to
others, and the donees of the recipients of the decedent's nonprobate
transfers to others, to the extent the donees have the property or its
proceeds, are liable to make a proportional contribution toward satisfaction
of the surviving spouse's elective-share or supplemental elective-share
amount.  A person liable to make contribution may choose to give up the
proportional part of the decedent's nonprobate transfers to him or to pay the
value of the amount for which he is liable.
(2)  If any section or subsection of this part is preempted by federal law
with respect to a payment, an item of property, or any other benefit included
in the decedent's nonprobate transfers to others, a person who, not for value,
receives the payment, item of property, or any other benefit is obligated to
return the payment, item of property, or benefit, or is personally liable for
the amount of the payment or the value of that item of property or benefit, as
provided in Section 75-2-209, to the person who would have been entitled to it
were that section or subsection not preempted.
