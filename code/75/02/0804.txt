(1)  As used in this section:
(a)  "Disposition or appointment of property" includes a transfer of an item
of property or any other benefit to a beneficiary designated in a governing
instrument.
(b)  "Divorce or annulment" means any divorce or annulment, or any dissolution
or declaration of invalidity of a marriage, that would exclude the spouse as a
surviving spouse within the meaning of Section 75-2-802.  A decree of
separation that does not terminate the status of husband and wife is not a
divorce for purposes of this section.
(c)  "Divorced individual" includes an individual whose marriage has been
annulled.
(d)  "Governing instrument" means a governing instrument executed by the
divorced individual before the divorce or annulment of his marriage to his
former spouse.
(e)  "Relative of the divorced individual's former spouse" means an individual
who is related to the divorced individual's former spouse by blood, adoption,
or affinity and who, after the divorce or annulment, is not related to the
divorced individual by blood, adoption, or affinity.
(f)  "Revocable," with respect to a disposition, appointment, provision, or
nomination, means one under which the divorced individual, at the time of the
divorce or annulment, was alone empowered, by law or under the governing
instrument, to cancel the designation in favor of his former spouse or former
spouse's relative, whether or not the divorced individual was then empowered
to designate himself in place of his former spouse or in place of his former
spouse's relative and whether or not the divorced individual then had the
capacity to exercise the power.
(2)  Except as provided by the express terms of a governing instrument, a
court order, or a contract relating to the division of the marital estate made
between the divorced individuals before or after the marriage, divorce, or
annulment, the divorce or annulment of a marriage:
(a)  revokes any revocable:
(i)  disposition or appointment of property made by a divorced individual to
his former spouse in a governing instrument and any disposition or appointment
created by law or in a governing instrument to a relative of the divorced
individual's former spouse;
(ii)  provision in a governing instrument conferring a general or nongeneral
power of appointment on the divorced individual's former spouse or on a
relative of the divorced individual's former spouse; and
(iii)  nomination in a governing instrument, nominating a divorced
individual's former spouse or a relative of the divorced individual's former
spouse to serve in any fiduciary or representative capacity, including a
personal representative, executor, trustee, conservator, agent, or guardian;
and
(b)  severs the interests of the former spouses in property held by them at
the time of the divorce or annulment as joint tenants with the right of
survivorship, transforming the interests of the former spouses into tenancies
in common.
(3)  A severance under Subsection (2)(b) does not affect any third-party
interest in property acquired for value and in good faith reliance on an
apparent title by survivorship in the survivor of the former spouses unless a
writing declaring the severance has been noted, registered, filed, or recorded
in records appropriate to the kind and location of the property which are
relied upon, in the ordinary course of transactions involving such property,
as evidence of ownership.
(4)  Provisions of a governing instrument are given effect as if the former
spouse and relatives of the former spouse disclaimed all provisions revoked by
this section or, in the case of a revoked nomination in a fiduciary or
representative capacity, as if the former spouse and relatives of the former
spouse died immediately before the divorce or annulment.
(5)  Provisions revoked solely by this section are revived by the divorced
individual's remarriage to the former spouse or by a nullification of the
divorce or annulment.
(6)  No change of circumstances other than as described in this section and in
Section 75-2-803 effects a revocation.
(7) (a)  A payor or other third party is not liable for having made a payment
or transferred an item of property or any other benefit to a beneficiary
designated in a governing instrument affected by a divorce, annulment, or
remarriage, or for having taken any other action in good faith reliance on the
validity of the governing instrument, before the payor or other third party
received written notice of the divorce, annulment, or remarriage.  A payor or
other third party is liable for a payment made or other action taken after the
payor or other third party received written notice of a claimed forfeiture or
revocation under this section.
(b)  Written notice of the divorce, annulment, or remarriage under Subsection
(7)(a) shall be mailed to the payor's or other third party's main office or
home by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or served upon
the payor or other third party in the same manner as a summons in a civil
action.  Upon receipt of written notice of the divorce, annulment, or
remarriage, a payor or other third party may pay any amount owed or transfer
or deposit any item of property held by it to or with the court having
jurisdiction of the probate proceedings relating to the decedent's estate or,
if no proceedings have been commenced, to or with the court having
jurisdiction of probate proceedings relating to the decedent's estates located
in the county of the decedent's residence.  The court shall hold the funds or
item of property and, upon its determination under this section, shall order
disbursement or transfer in accordance with the determination.  Payments,
transfers, or deposits made to or with the court discharge the payor or other
third party from all claims for the value of amounts paid to or items of
property transferred to or deposited with the court.
(8) (a)  A person who purchases property from a former spouse, relative of a
former spouse, or any other person for value and without notice, or who
receives from a former spouse, relative of a former spouse, or any other
person a payment or other item of property in partial or full satisfaction of
a legally enforceable obligation, is neither obligated under this section to
return the payment, item of property, or benefit nor is liable under this
section for the amount of the payment or the value of the item of property or
benefit.  But a former spouse, relative of a former spouse, or other person
who, not for value, received a payment, item of property, or any other benefit
to which that person is not entitled under this section is obligated to return
the payment, item of property, or benefit, or is personally liable for the
amount of the payment or the value of the item of property or benefit, to the
person who is entitled to it under this section.
(b)  If this section or any part of this section is preempted by federal law
with respect to a payment, an item of property, or any other benefit covered
by this section, a former spouse, relative of the former spouse, or any other
person who, not for value, received a payment, item of property, or any other
benefit to which that person is not entitled under this section is obligated
to return that payment, item of property, or benefit, or is personally liable
for the amount of the payment or the value of the item of property or benefit,
to the person who would have been entitled to it were this section or part of
this section not preempted.
