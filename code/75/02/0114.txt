75-2-114.   Parent and child relationship.
(1)  Except as provided in Subsections (2) and (3), for purposes of intestate
succession by, through, or from a person, an individual is the child of the
individual's natural parents, regardless of their marital status.  The parent
and child relationship may be established as provided in Title 78B, Chapter
15, Utah Uniform Parentage Act.
(2)  An adopted individual is the child of the adopting parent or parents and
not of the natural parents, but adoption of a child by the spouse of either
natural parent has no effect on:
(a)  the relationship between the child and that natural parent; or
(b)  the right of the child or a descendant of the child to inherit from or
through the other natural parent.
(3)  Inheritance from or through a child by either natural parent or his
kindred is precluded unless that natural parent has openly treated the child
as his, and has not refused to support the child.
