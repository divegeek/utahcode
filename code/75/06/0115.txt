75-6-115.   Agency accounts.
Nothing in this chapter shall preclude a party to an account from adding the
name of another person to such an account with the designation "agent." This
agent shall have no present or future interest in the sums on deposit in such
account, but the financial institution may honor requests for payment from
such account by such agent, whether the principal be incapacitated or deceased
at the time the payment is demanded, unless the financial institution has
actual knowledge of such death or incapacity. Payments from such account by
such financial institution at the request of such agent shall discharge such
financial institution from all claims for amounts so paid.
