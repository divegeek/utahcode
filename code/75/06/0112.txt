75-6-112.   Financial institution protection -- Discharge.
Payment made pursuant to Section 75-6-108, 75-6-109, 75-6-110 or 75-6-111
discharges the financial institution from all claims for amounts so paid
whether or not the payment is consistent with the beneficial ownership of the
account as between parties, P.O.D. payees, or beneficiaries, or their
successors. The protection here given does not extend to payments made after a
financial institution has received written notice from any party able to
request present payment to the effect that withdrawals in accordance with the
terms of the account should not be permitted. Unless the notice is withdrawn
by the person giving it, the successor of any deceased party must concur in
any demand for withdrawal if the financial institution is to be protected
under this section. No other notice or any other information shown to have
been available to a financial institution shall affect its right to the
protection provided here. The protection here provided shall have no bearing
on the rights of parties in disputes between themselves or their successors
concerning the beneficial ownership of funds in, or withdrawn from, multiple-
party accounts.
