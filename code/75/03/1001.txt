75-3-1001.   Formal proceedings terminating administration -- Testate or
intestate -- Order of general protection.
(1) A personal representative or any interested person may petition for an
order of complete settlement of the estate. The personal representative may
petition at any time, and any other interested person may petition after one
year from the appointment of the original personal representative except that
no petition under this section may be entertained until the time for
presenting claims which arose prior to the death of the decedent has expired.
The petition may request the court to determine testacy, if not previously
determined, to consider the final account or compel or approve an accounting
and distribution, to construe any will or determine heirs, and to adjudicate
the final settlement and distribution of the estate. After notice to all
interested persons and hearing the court may enter an order or orders, on
appropriate conditions, determining the persons entitled to distribution of
the estate, and, as circumstances require, approving settlement and directing
or approving distribution of the estate and discharging the personal
representative from further claim or demand of any interested person.
(2)  If one or more heirs or devisees were omitted as parties in, or were not
given notice of, a previous formal testacy proceeding, the court, on proper
petition for an order of complete settlement of the estate under this section,
and after notice to the omitted or unnotified persons and other interested
parties determined to be interested on the assumption that the previous order
concerning testacy is conclusive as to those given notice of the earlier
proceeding, may determine testacy as it affects the omitted persons and
confirm or alter the previous order of testacy as it affects all interested
persons as appropriate in the light of the new proofs. In the absence of
objection by an omitted or unnotified person, evidence received in the
original testacy proceeding shall constitute prima facie proof of due
execution of any will previously admitted to probate, or of the fact that the
decedent left no valid will if the prior proceedings determined this fact.
