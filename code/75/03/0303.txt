75-3-303.   Informal probate -- Proof and findings required.
(1)  In an informal proceeding for original probate of a will, the registrar
shall determine whether:
(a)  the application is complete;
(b)  the applicant has made oath or affirmation that the statements contained
in the application are true to the best of his knowledge and belief;
(c)  the applicant appears from the application to be an interested person as
defined in Subsection 75-1-201(24);
(d)  on the basis of the statements in the application, venue is proper;
(e)  an original, duly executed and apparently unrevoked will is in the
registrar's possession;
(f)  any notice required by Section 75-3-204 has been given and that the
application is not within Section 75-3-304; and
(g)  it appears from the application that the time limit for original probate
has not expired.
(2)  The application shall be denied if it indicates that a personal
representative has been appointed in another county of this state or except as
provided in Subsection (4), if it appears that this or another will of the
decedent has been the subject of a previous probate order.
(3)  A will which appears to have the required signatures and which contains
an attestation clause showing that requirements of execution under Section
75-2-502, 75-2-503, or 75-2-506 have been met shall be probated without
further proof. In other cases, the registrar may assume execution if the will
appears to have been properly executed, or he may accept a sworn statement or
affidavit of any person having knowledge of the circumstances of execution,
whether or not the person was a witness to the will.
(4)  Informal probate of a will which has been previously probated elsewhere
may be granted at any time upon written application by any interested person,
together with deposit of an authenticated copy of the will and of the
statement probating it from the office or court where it was first probated.
(5)  A will from a place which does not provide for probate of a will after
death and which is not eligible for probate under Subsection (1) above may be
probated in this state upon receipt by the registrar of a duly authenticated
copy of the will and a duly authenticated certificate of its legal custodian
that the copy filed is a true copy and that the will has become operative
under the law of the other place.
