75-3-106.   Scope of proceedings -- Proceedings independent -- Exception.
(1) Unless supervised administration as described in Part 5 of this chapter is
involved:
(a)  Each proceeding before the court or registrar is independent of any other
proceeding involving the same estate.
(b)  Petitions for formal orders of the court may combine various requests for
relief in a single proceeding if the orders sought may be finally granted
without delay. Except as required for proceedings which are particularly
described by other sections of this chapter, no petition is defective because
it fails to embrace all matters which might then be the subject of a final
order.
(c)  Proceedings for probate of wills or adjudications of no will may be
combined with proceedings for appointment of personal representatives.
(d)  A proceeding for appointment of a personal representative is concluded by
an order making or declining the appointment.
