75-3-1101.   Effect of approval of agreements involving trusts, inalienable
interests, or interests of third persons.
A compromise of any controversy as to admission to probate of any instrument
offered for formal probate as the will of a decedent, the construction,
validity, or effect of any probated will, the rights or interests in the
estate of the decedent, any successor, or the administration of the estate, if
approved in a formal proceeding in the court for that purpose, is binding on
all the parties thereto, including those unborn, unascertained, or who could
not be located. An approved compromise is binding even though it may affect a
trust or an inalienable interest. A compromise does not impair the rights of
creditors or of taxing authorities who are not parties to it.
