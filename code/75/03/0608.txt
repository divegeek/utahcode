75-3-608.   Termination of appointment -- General.
Termination of appointment of a personal representative occurs as indicated in
Sections 75-3-609 through 75-3-612.  Termination ends the right and power
pertaining to the office of personal representative as conferred by this code
or any will, except that a personal representative, at any time prior to
distribution or until restrained or enjoined by court order, may perform acts
necessary to protect the estate and may deliver the assets to a successor
representative.  Termination does not discharge a personal representative from
liability for transactions or omissions occurring before termination or
relieve him of the duty to preserve assets subject to his control, to account
therefor, and to deliver the assets.  Termination does not affect the
jurisdiction of the court over the personal representative but terminates his
authority to represent the estate in any pending or future proceeding.
