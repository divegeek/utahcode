75-3-414.   Formal proceedings concerning appointment of personal
representative.
(1) A formal proceeding for adjudication regarding the priority or
qualification of one who is an applicant for appointment as personal
representative, or of one who previously has been appointed personal
representative in informal proceedings, if an issue concerning the testacy of
the decedent is or may be involved, is governed by Section 75-3-402, as well
as by this section. In other cases, the petition shall contain or adopt the
statements required by Subsection 75-3-301(2) and describe the question
relating to priority or qualification of the personal representative which is
to be resolved. If the proceeding precedes any appointment of a personal
representative, it shall stay any pending informal appointment proceedings as
well as any commenced thereafter. If the proceeding is commenced after
appointment, the previously appointed personal representative, after receipt
of notice thereof, shall refrain from exercising any power of administration
except as necessary to preserve the estate or unless the court orders
otherwise.
(2)  After notice to interested persons, including all persons interested in
the administration of the estate as successors under the applicable assumption
concerning testacy, any previously appointed personal representative and any
person having or claiming priority for appointment as personal representative,
the court shall determine who is entitled to appointment under Section
75-3-203, make a proper appointment and, if appropriate, terminate any prior
appointment found to have been improper as provided in cases of removal under
Section 75-3-611.
