75-3-710.   Powers of personal representatives -- In general.
Until termination of his appointment a personal representative has the same
power over the title to property of the estate that an absolute owner would
have, in trust, however, for the benefit of the creditors and others
interested in the estate. This power may be exercised without notice, hearing,
or order of court, unless otherwise specifically provided by this code.
