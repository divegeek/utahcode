75-3-305.   Informal probate -- Registrar not satisfied.

If the registrar is not satisfied that a will is entitled to be probated in informal proceedings because of failure to meet the requirements of Sections 75-3-303 and 75-3-304 or any other reason, he may decline the application. A declination of informal probate is not an adjudication and does not preclude formal probate proceedings.



Enacted by Chapter 150, 1975 General Session
