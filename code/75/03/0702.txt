75-3-702.   Priority among different letters.
A person to whom general letters are issued first has exclusive authority
under the letters until his appointment is terminated or modified. If, through
error, general letters are afterwards issued to another, the first appointed
representative may recover any property of the estate in the hands of the
representative subsequently appointed, but the acts of the latter done in good
faith before notice of the first letters are not void for want of validity of
appointment.
