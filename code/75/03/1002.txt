75-3-1002.   Formal proceedings terminating testate administration -- Order
construing will without adjudicating testacy.
A personal representative administering an estate under an informally probated
will or any devisee under an informally probated will may petition for an
order of settlement of the estate which will not adjudicate the testacy status
of the decedent. The personal representative may petition at any time, and a
devisee may petition after one year from the appointment of the original
personal representative, except that no petition under this section may be
entertained until the time for presenting claims which arose prior to the
death of the decedent has expired. The petition may request the court to
consider the final account or compel or approve an accounting and
distribution, to construe the will, and to adjudicate final settlement and
distribution of the estate. After notice to all devisees and the personal
representative and hearing, the court may enter an order or orders, on
appropriate conditions, determining the persons entitled to distribution of
the estate under the will, and, as circumstances require, approving settlement
and directing or approving distribution of the estate and discharging the
personal representative from further claim or demand of any devisee who is a
party to the proceeding and those he represents. If it appears that a part of
the estate is intestate, the proceedings shall be dismissed or amendments made
to meet the provisions of Section 75-3-1001.
