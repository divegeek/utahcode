75-3-718.   Compensation of personal representative and attorney.

(1)  A personal representative and an attorney are entitled to reasonable compensation for their services.  If a petition is filed which either directly or indirectly seeks approval of the personal representative's compensation or the attorney's compensation and if no objection is filed by an interested person to the compensation requested, reasonable compensation shall be the compensation sought in the petition. When an interested person objects to the personal representative's compensation, the court shall determine reasonable compensation for the personal representative based on the quality, quantity, and value of the services rendered to the estate and the circumstances under which those services were rendered, including the practice for other fiduciaries who are in similar circumstances to the personal representative in question. When an interested person objects to the attorney's compensation, the court shall determine reasonable compensation for the attorney.

(2)  When a petition seeks approval of or objects to a personal representative's compensation or an attorney's compensation, at least 10 days before the time set for the hearing of the petition, the petitioner or the petitioner's attorney shall send a copy of the petition to all interested persons either by certified, registered, or first class mail or by hand-delivery.

(3)  If a will provides for compensation of the personal representative and there is no contract with the decedent regarding compensation,  the personal representative may renounce the provision before qualifying and be entitled to reasonable compensation.  A personal representative also may renounce his right to all or any part of the compensation.  A written renunciation of fee may be filed with the court.
