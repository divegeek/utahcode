75-3-309.   Informal appointment proceedings -- Registrar not satisfied.
If the registrar is not satisfied that a requested informal appointment of a
personal representative should be made because of failure to meet the
requirements of Sections 75-3-307 and 75-3-308, or for any other reason, he
may decline the application. A declination of informal appointment is not an
adjudication and does not preclude appointment in formal proceedings.
