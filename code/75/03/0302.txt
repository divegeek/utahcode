75-3-302.   Informal probate -- Duty of registrar -- Effect of informal
probate.
After receipt of an application requesting informal probate of a will, the
registrar, upon making the findings required by Section 75-3-303 shall issue a
written statement of informal probate if at least ten days have elapsed since
the date of the notice required by Section 75-3-306, or if at least 120 hours
have elapsed since the decedent's death and all persons entitled to notice
under Section 75-3-306 have waived such notice in writing. Informal probate is
conclusive as to all persons until superseded by an order in a formal testacy
proceeding. No defect in the application or procedure relating thereto which
leads to informal probate of a will renders the probate void.
