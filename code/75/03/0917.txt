75-3-917.   Certain formula clauses to be construed to refer to federal
estate and generation-skipping transfer tax rules applicable to estates of
decedents dying after December 31, 2009.
(1)  A will or trust of a decedent who dies after December 31, 2009 and before
January 1, 2011, that contains a formula referring to the "unified credit,"
"estate tax exemption," "applicable exemption amount," "generation-skipping
transfer tax exemption" or "GST exemption," or that measures a share of an
estate or trust based on the amount that can pass free of federal estate or
generation-skipping transfer taxes, or that is otherwise based on a similar
provision of federal estate tax or generation-skipping transfer tax law, shall
be considered to refer to the federal estate and generation-skipping transfer
tax laws as they applied with respect to estates of decedents dying on
December 31, 2009.
(a)  This provision may not apply with respect to a will or trust executed or
amended after December 31, 2009, or that manifests an intent that a contrary
rule shall apply if the decedent dies on a date on which there is no then-
applicable federal estate or generation-skipping transfer tax.
(b)  The reference to January 1, 2011 in Subsection (1) shall, if the federal
estate and generation-skipping transfer tax becomes effective before that
date, refer instead to the first date on which the tax becomes legally
effective.
(2)  A proceeding to determine whether the decedent intended that the
references under Subsection (1) be construed with respect to the law as it
existed after December 31, 2009, shall be filed within 12 months of the date
of death of the testator or grantor.  It may be filed by the personal
representative or any affected beneficiary under the will or other instrument.
