75-3-1003.   Closing estates -- By sworn statement of personal
representative -- Waiver of accountings.
(1)  Unless prohibited by order of the court and except for estates being
administered in supervised administration proceedings when all of the
distributees of the estate consent in writing, a personal representative may
close an estate by filing with the court no earlier than four months after the
date of original appointment of a general personal representative for the
estate, a verified statement stating that the personal representative, or a
prior personal representative whom the personal representative has succeeded,
has:
(a)  determined that the time limitation for presentation of creditors' claims
has expired;
(b)  fully administered the estate of the decedent by making payment,
settlement, or other disposition of all claims which were presented, expenses
of administration and estate, inheritance and other death taxes, except as
specified in the statement, and that the assets of the estate have been
distributed to the persons entitled.  If any claims remain undischarged, the
statement shall state whether the personal representative has distributed the
estate subject to possible liability with the agreement of the distributees or
it shall state in detail other arrangements which have been made to
accommodate outstanding liabilities; and
(c)  sent a copy of the statement to all distributees of the estate and to all
creditors or other claimants of whom he is aware whose claims are neither paid
nor barred and has furnished a full account in writing of his administration
to the distributees whose interests are affected thereby.
(2)  If no proceedings involving the personal representative are pending in
the court one year after the closing statement is filed, the appointment of
the personal representative terminates.
(3)  Any accounting required under this section or either Section 75-3-1001 or
75-3-1002 may be waived when all of the distributees of the estate consent in
writing to the waiver.
