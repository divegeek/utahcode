75-3-807.   Payment of claims.
(1)  Upon the expiration of the earliest of the time limitations provided in
Section 75-3-803 for the presentation of claims, the personal representative
shall proceed to pay the claims allowed against the estate in the order of
priority prescribed, after making provision for homestead, family, and support
allowances, for claims already presented which have not yet been allowed or
whose allowance has been appealed, and for unbarred claims which may yet be
presented, including costs and expenses of administration.  By petition to the
court in a proceeding for the purpose, or by appropriate motion if the
administration is supervised, a claimant whose claim has been allowed but not
paid as provided in this section may secure an order directing the personal
representative to pay the claim to the extent that funds of the estate are
available for the payment.
(2)  The personal representative at any time may pay any just claim that has
not been barred, with or without formal presentation, but he is personally
liable to any other claimant whose claim is allowed and who is injured by such
payment if:
(a)  the payment was made before the expiration of the time limit stated in
Subsection (1) and the personal representative failed to require the payee to
give adequate security for the refund of any of the payment necessary to pay
other claimants; or
(b)  the payment was made, due to the negligence or willful fault of the
personal representative, in such manner as to deprive the injured claimant of
his priority.
