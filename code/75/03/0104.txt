75-3-104.   Claims against decedent -- Necessity of administration.

No proceeding to enforce a claim against the estate of a decedent or his successors may be revived or commenced before the appointment of a personal representative. After the appointment and until distribution, all proceedings and actions to enforce a claim against the estate are governed by the procedure prescribed by this Chapter 3. After distribution a creditor whose claim has not been barred may recover from the distributees as provided in Section 75-3-1004 or from a former personal representative individually liable as provided in Section 75-3-1005. This section has no application to a proceeding by a secured creditor of the decedent to enforce his right to his security except as to any deficiency judgment which might be sought therein.
