(1)  retain assets owned by the decedent pending distribution or liquidation including those in which the representative is personally interested or which are otherwise improper for trust investment;

(2)  receive assets from fiduciaries, or other sources;

(3)  perform, compromise, or refuse performance of the decedent's contracts that continue as obligations of the estate, as he may determine under the circumstances.  In performing enforceable contracts by the decedent to convey or lease land, the personal representative, among other possible courses of action, may:

(5)  if funds are not needed to meet debts and expenses currently payable and are not immediately distributable, deposit or invest liquid assets of the estate, including money received from the sale of other assets, in federally insured interest-bearing accounts, readily marketable secured loan arrangements, or other prudent investments which would be reasonable for use by trustees generally;

(10)  enter into a lease or arrangement for exploration and removal of minerals or other natural resources or enter into a pooling or unitization agreement;

(11)  abandon property when, in the opinion of the personal representative, it is valueless, is so encumbered, or is in condition that it is of no benefit to the estate;

(12)  vote stocks or other securities in person or by general or limited proxy;

(13)  pay calls, assessments, and other sums chargeable or accruing against or on account of securities, unless barred by the provisions relating to claims;

(14)  hold a security in the name of a nominee or in other form without disclosure of the interest of the estate but the personal representative is liable for any act of the nominee in connection with the security so held;

(18)  pay taxes, assessments, compensation of the personal representative, and other expenses incident to the administration of the estate;

(21)  employ persons, including attorneys, auditors, investment advisers, or agents, even if they are associated with the personal representative, to advise or assist the personal representative in the performance of his administrative duties; act without independent investigation upon their recommendations; and instead of acting personally, employ one or more agents to perform any act of administration, whether or not discretionary;

(22)  prosecute or defend claims or proceedings in any jurisdiction for the protection of the estate and of the personal representative in the performance of his duties;

(23)  sell, mortgage, or lease any real or personal property of the estate or any interest in it for cash, credit, or for part cash and part credit, and with or without security for unpaid balances;

(24)  continue any unincorporated business or venture in which the decedent was engaged at the time of his death:

(a)  in the same business form for a period of not more than four months from the date of appointment of a general personal representative if continuation is a reasonable means of preserving the value of the business including good will;

(b)  in the same business form for any additional period of time that may be approved by order of the court in a formal proceeding to which the persons interested in the estate are parties; or

(c)  throughout the period of administration if the business is incorporated by the personal representative and if none of the probable distributees of the business who are competent adults object to its incorporation and retention in the estate;
