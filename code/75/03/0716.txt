75-3-716.   Co-representatives -- When joint action required.
If two or more persons are appointed co-representatives and unless the will
provides otherwise, the concurrence of a majority is required on all acts
connected with the administration and distribution of the estate. This
restriction does not apply when any co-representative receives and receipts
for property due the estate, when the concurrence of all cannot readily be
obtained in the time reasonably available for emergency action necessary to
preserve the estate, or when a co-representative has been delegated to act for
the others. Persons dealing with a co-representative if actually unaware that
another has been appointed to serve with him or if advised by the personal
representative with whom they deal that he has authority to act alone for any
of the reasons mentioned herein, are as fully protected as if the person with
whom they dealt had been the sole personal representative.
