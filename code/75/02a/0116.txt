75-2a-116.   Presumption of validity of directive.
(1)  A health care directive executed under this chapter is presumed valid and
binding.
(2)  Health care providers and health care facilities, in the absence of
notice to the contrary, shall presume that a declarant who executed a health
care directive, whether or not in the presence of a health care provider, had
the required decision making capacity at the time the declarant signed the
directive.  The fact a declarant executed a health care directive shall not be
construed as an indication that the declarant was suffering from mental
illness or lacked decision making capacity.
