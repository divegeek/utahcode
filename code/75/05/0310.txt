75-5-310.   Temporary guardians.
(1) If an incapacitated person has no guardian and an emergency exists or if
an appointed guardian is not effectively performing his duties and the court
further finds that the welfare of the incapacitated person requires immediate
action, it may, without notice, appoint an appropriate official as temporary
guardian for the person for a specified period not to exceed 30 days pending
notice and hearing.
(2)  The court shall, in all cases in which a temporary guardian is appointed,
hold a hearing within five days pursuant to Section 75-5-303. Unless the
allegedly incapacitated person has already obtained counsel, the court may
appoint an appropriate official or attorney to represent that person in the
proceeding. Until the full hearing and order of the court, the temporary
guardian shall be charged with the care and custody of the ward and shall not
permit the ward to be removed from this state. The authority of any permanent
guardian previously appointed by the court is suspended so long as a temporary
guardian has authority. A temporary guardian may be removed at any time, and
shall obey such orders and make such reports as the court requires.
