75-5-426.   Enlargement or limitation of powers of conservator.

Subject to the restrictions of Subsection 75-5-408(1)(d), the court may confer on a conservator at the time of appointment or later, in addition to the powers conferred on him by Sections 75-5-424 and 75-5-425, any power which the court itself could exercise under Subsections 75-5-408(1)(b) and 75-5-408(1)(c).  The court may, at the time of appointment or later, limit the powers of a conservator otherwise conferred by Sections 75-5-424 and 75-5-425, or previously conferred by the court, and may at any time relieve him of any limitation.  If the court limits any power conferred on the conservator by Section 75-5-424 or 75-5-425, the limitation shall be endorsed upon his letters of appointment.
