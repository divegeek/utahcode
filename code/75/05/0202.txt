75-5-202.   Appointment of guardian of minor.
(1) The parent of a minor may appoint a guardian of an unemancipated minor by
will, as provided in this section, or by other written instrument as provided
in Section 75-5-202.5.
(2)  Subject to the rights of the minor and others under Section 75-5-203, an
appointment by will or written instrument becomes effective upon filing the
guardian's acceptance in the court in which the will is probated or the
document is filed, if before acceptance, both parents are dead or the
surviving parent is adjudged incapacitated.
(3)  If both parents are dead, an effective appointment by the parent who died
later has priority.
(4)  This state recognizes a testamentary appointment effected by filing the
guardian's acceptance under a will probated in another state which is the
testator's domicile.
(5)  Upon acceptance of appointment, written notice of acceptance shall be
given by the guardian to the minor and to the person having his care, or to
his nearest adult relative.
