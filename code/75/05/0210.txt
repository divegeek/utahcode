75-5-210.   Termination of appointment of guardian -- General.
A guardian's authority and responsibility terminates upon the death,
resignation, or removal of the guardian or upon the minor's death, adoption,
marriage, or attainment of majority, but termination does not affect his
liability for prior acts nor his obligation to account for funds and assets of
his ward. Resignation of a guardian does not terminate the guardianship until
it has been approved by the court. A testamentary appointment under an
informally probated will terminates if the will is later denied probate in a
formal proceeding.
