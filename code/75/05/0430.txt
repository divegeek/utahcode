75-5-430.   Termination of proceeding.
The protected person, his personal representative, the conservator, or any
other interested person may petition the court to terminate the
conservatorship. A protected person seeking termination is entitled to the
same rights and procedures as in an original proceeding for a protective
order. The court, upon determining after notice and hearing that the minority
or disability of the protected person has ceased, may terminate the
conservatorship. Upon termination, title to assets of the estate passes to the
former protected person or to his successors, subject to provision in the
order for expenses of administration or to conveyances from the conservator to
the former protected persons or his successors to evidence the transfer.
