75-5-428.   Claims against protected person -- Enforcement.
(1)  A conservator must pay from the estate all just claims against the estate
and against the protected person arising before or after the conservatorship
upon their presentation and allowance.  A claim may be presented by either of
the following methods:
(a)  The claimant may deliver or mail to the conservator a written statement
of the claim indicating its basis, the name and address of the claimant, and
the amount claimed.
(b)  The claimant may file a written statement of the claim, in the form
prescribed by rule, with the clerk of the court and deliver or mail a copy of
the statement to the conservator.  A claim is considered presented on the
first to occur of receipt of the written statement of claim by the
conservator, or the filing of the claim with the court.
(2)  A presented claim is allowed if it is not disallowed by written statement
mailed by the conservator to the claimant within 60 days after its
presentation.  The presentation of a claim tolls any statute of limitation
relating to the claim until 30 days after its disallowance.
(3)  A claimant whose claim has not been paid may petition the court for
determination of his claim at any time before it is barred by the applicable
statute of limitation, and, upon due proof, procure an order for its allowance
and payment from the estate.  If a proceeding is pending against a protected
person at the time of appointment of a conservator or is initiated against the
protected person thereafter, the moving party must give notice of the
proceeding to the conservator if the outcome is to constitute a claim against
the estate.
(4)  If it appears that the estate in conservatorship is likely to be
exhausted before all existing claims are paid, preference is to be given to
prior claims for the care, maintenance, and education of the protected person
or his dependents and existing claims for expenses of administration.
