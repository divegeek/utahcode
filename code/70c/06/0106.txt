70C-6-106.   Refund or credit required -- Amount.
(1)  A debtor or his estate is entitled to any rebate or refund due from an
insurer and to any unearned part of a separate charge for insurance previously
paid by the debtor, resulting from the prepayment of a consumer credit debt,
except when all refunds and credits due to the debtor under this title amount
to less than $5.
(2)  A creditor shall promptly make or cause to be made an appropriate refund
or credit to the debtor with respect to any separate charge made to him for
insurance if:
(a)  the insurance is not provided or is provided for a shorter term than that
for which the charge to a debtor for insurance was computed; or
(b)  the insurance terminates prior to the end of the term for which it was
written because of prepayment in full or otherwise.
(3)  All refunds or credit required by this section shall be computed
according to a method prescribed or approved by the Insurance Department or
formula filed by the insurer with the Insurance Department at least 30 days
before any debtor's right to a refund or credit becomes determinable, unless
the method or formula is employed after the Insurance Department notifies the
insurer that the method or formula has been disapproved.
(4)  Except as provided in Subsection (1), a creditor is not obligated to
account to a debtor for any portion of a separate charge for insurance when:
(a)  the insurance is terminated by performance of the insurer's obligation;
(b)  the creditor pays or accounts for premiums to the insurer in amounts and
at times determined by the agreement between them; or
(c)  the creditor receives directly or indirectly under any policy of
insurance a gain or advantage not prohibited by law.
