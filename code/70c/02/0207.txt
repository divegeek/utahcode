70C-2-207.   Referral sales.

With respect to a consumer credit sale, the seller may not give or offer to give a rebate or discount or otherwise pay or offer to pay value to the buyer as an inducement for a sale in consideration of his giving to the seller the names of prospective purchasers or otherwise aiding the seller in making a sale to another person, if the earning of the rebate, discount, or other value is contingent upon the occurrence of an event subsequent to the time the buyer agrees to buy.  If a buyer is induced by a violation of this section to enter into a consumer credit sale, the agreement is unenforceable by the seller and the buyer may rescind the agreement and retain any goods delivered until all payments made by the debtor have been fully refunded to him.  The buyer may retain the benefit of any services performed without any obligation to pay for them.  This section does not apply if any goods delivered to the buyer are damaged while in the buyer's possession or are not delivered to the seller at the buyer's residence, or at any other place agreed on by the parties, within a reasonable time after the seller tenders or delivers a full refund of all payments to the buyer.
