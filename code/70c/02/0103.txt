70C-2-103.   Deferral charges.

(1)  The parties to any consumer credit agreement before or after default may agree in writing to defer all or part of one or more unpaid installments.  Except in connection with an open-end credit agreement, the parties may also agree in writing at any time that if an installment is not paid within 10 days after its due date, the creditor may unilaterally grant a deferral.  The creditor may collect a reasonable charge which the debtor expressly agrees to pay as consideration for a deferral.  A deferral charge may be collected at the time it accrues or at any time thereafter.

(2)  A delinquency charge made by the creditor on an installment may not be retained if a deferral charge is agreed to under this section covering the same period of delinquency.  A creditor that accelerates the maturity of a consumer credit debt may not make or collect a deferral charge for any period following the date acceleration is declared.
