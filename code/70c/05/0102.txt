(a)  the buyer requests the seller to provide goods or services without delay because of an emergency;

(b)  the seller in good faith makes a substantial beginning of performance of the contract before the buyer gives notice of cancellation; and

(c)  in the case of goods, the goods cannot be returned to the seller in substantially as good condition as when received by the buyer.
