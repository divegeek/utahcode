70C-3-103.   Delinquency charges -- Conversion of account.

(1)  With respect to a closed-end loan, a delinquency charge may not be assessed on a payment that is a payment in full for the scheduled installment period solely because of an unpaid delinquency charge relating to an earlier installment.

(b)  In the event of conversion under Subsection (2)(a):

(i)  the creditor shall calculate the unpaid balance of the debt in accordance with the provisions governing rebate on prepayment under Section 70C-3-101 as of the due date of the first delinquent installment; and

(ii)  after the conversion the creditor may collect a finance charge not exceeding the annual rate agreed upon by the parties.
