70C-8-105.   Judicial review.
(1)  Any party aggrieved by any rule, order, temporary order, decision,
ruling, or other act or failure to act by the department under this title is
entitled to judicial review.  Within 30 days after receiving notice of a rule,
order, temporary order, decision, or other ruling, or within 120 days after
the department has failed to act upon a request or application, the aggrieved
party may file an application for judicial review with a court of competent
jurisdiction in the county in which the applicant is located or in the Third
District Court.  The court may void any rule, order, temporary order,
decision, ruling, or other act of the department it finds to be arbitrary,
capricious, an abuse of discretion, in excess of the department's authority,
or otherwise contrary to law.
(2)  Any party upon showing that it may be subject to potential irreparable
injury by any proposed rule or order of the department may, without exhausting
its administrative remedies, apply for a declaratory judgment as to any
question of law arising out of the rule or order.  The applications shall be
filed in the Third District Court.
(3)  Any action for judicial review of acts or failures to act of the
department shall be heard by the court and shall be based on the record made
before the department unless the court finds good cause to admit additional
and otherwise proper evidence.
(4)  Filing an application for judicial review does not stay the adoption or
enforcement of any rule, order, temporary order, decision, or ruling of the
department.  The court may expressly stay any rule, order, decision, or ruling
of the department during the pendency of judicial proceedings challenging them
upon terms and conditions it deems appropriate after finding that the possible
harm to all interested parties is, on balance, likely to be less if the stay
is imposed, or if the applicant and the department stipulate to the imposition
of a stay.
