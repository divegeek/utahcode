31A-2-306.   Judicial review -- Costs.
(1)  A person aggrieved by a rule or order of the commissioner, or aggrieved
by the commissioner's failure to act when he has a duty to act, may obtain
judicial review.
(2)  The court reviewing agency actions governed by this title shall give
priority to those actions and shall hear and determine them promptly.
(3)  Costs shall be awarded as in civil cases.  If the court finds that the
appeal from action or inaction stemmed from the bad faith or malice of the
commissioner, the court may award reasonable attorney's fees to the prevailing
petitioner.  Section 63G-7-701 applies to the extent the attorney's fees
awarded under this subsection exceed $10,000 for any one appeal.
