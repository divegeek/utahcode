31A-9-213.   Amendment of articles of incorporation.

(1)  The articles of a fraternal may provide for amendment by the supreme governing body or by the board of directors, and may also provide for amendment by an affirmative vote of a majority of those members who vote in a referendum.  Only votes cast within 60 days from the date of mailing the first ballot by the fraternal are counted.  The timeliness of a vote is determined by the date of its mailing as evidenced by its postmark or other suitable evidence.

(2)  For five years after the initial issuance of a certificate of authority, proposed amendments of the articles shall be filed with the commissioner at least 30 days before the amendment is submitted for approval to the members or to the supreme governing body.  If the approval of the members or the supreme governing body is not required, proposed amendments to the articles shall be filed with the commissioner at least 30 days before their effective date.

(3)  No amendment is effective until the articles of amendment are filed with the commissioner, together with a statement of the results of the voting on the amendment or a statement that no vote is required.

(4)  Within four months after filing the articles of amendment with the commissioner, they shall be furnished to all members either by mail or under Subsection 31A-9-402(1).
