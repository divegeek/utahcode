31A-22-618.   Nondiscrimination among health care professionals.
(1)  Except as provided under Section 31A-22-617, and except as to insurers
licensed under Chapter 8, no insurer may unfairly discriminate against any
licensed class of health care providers by structuring contract exclusions
which exclude payment of benefits for the treatment of any illness, injury, or
condition by any licensed class of health care providers when the treatment is
within the scope of the licensee's practice and the illness, injury, or
condition falls within the coverage of the contract.  Upon the written request
of an insured alleging an insurer has violated this section, the commissioner
shall hold a hearing to determine if the violation exists.  The commissioner
may consolidate two or more related alleged violations into a single hearing.
(2)  This section does not apply to catastrophic mental health coverage
provided in accordance with Section 31A-22-625.
