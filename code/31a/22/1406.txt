31A-22-1406.   Preexisting conditions.
(1)  A long-term care insurance policy or certificate shall not use a
definition of a preexisting condition which is more restrictive than the
following: "Preexisting condition means a condition for which medical advice
or treatment was recommended by or received from a provider of health care
services, within six months preceding the effective date of coverage of an
insured person."
(2)  A long-term care insurance policy or certificate may not exclude coverage
for a loss or confinement which is the result of a preexisting condition
unless such loss or confinement begins within six months following the
effective date of coverage of an insured person.
(3)  The commissioner may extend the preexisting condition periods provided in
Subsections (1) and (2) as to specific age group categories in specific policy
forms upon finding that the extension is in the best interest of the public.
(4) (a)  The definition of preexisting condition does not prohibit an insurer
from using an application form designed to elicit the complete health history
of an applicant and from underwriting in accordance with that insurer's
established underwriting standards on the basis of the answers on that
application.
(b)  Unless otherwise provided in the policy or certificate, a preexisting
condition, regardless of whether it is disclosed on the application, need not
be covered until the waiting period described in Subsection (2) expires.
(c)  A long-term care insurance policy or certificate may not exclude or use
waivers or riders of any kind to exclude, limit, or reduce coverage or
benefits for specifically named or described preexisting diseases or physical
condition beyond the waiting period described in Subsection (2).
