(1)  Any provision dealing with preexisting conditions shall be consistent with this section, Section 31A-22-609, and rules adopted by the commissioner.

(2)  Except as provided in this section, an insurer that elects to use an application form without questions concerning the insured's health or medical treatment history shall provide coverage under the policy for any loss which occurs more than 12 months after the effective date of coverage due to a preexisting condition which is not specifically excluded from coverage.

(3) (a)  An insurer that issues a specified disease policy may not deny a claim for loss due to a preexisting condition that occurs more than six months after the effective date of coverage.

(b)  A specified disease policy may impose a preexisting condition exclusion only if the exclusion relates to a preexisting condition which first manifested itself within six months prior to the effective date of coverage or which was diagnosed by a physician at any time prior to the effective date of coverage.

(4) (a)  Except as provided in this Subsection (4), a health benefit plan may impose a preexisting condition exclusion only if:

(i)  the exclusion relates to a preexisting condition for which medical advice, diagnosis, care, or treatment was recommended or received within the six-month period ending on the enrollment date from an individual licensed or similarly authorized to provide those services under state law and operating within the scope of practice authorized by state law;

(ii)  the exclusion period ends no later than 12 months after the enrollment date, or in the case of a late enrollee, 18 months after the enrollment date; and

(iii)  the exclusion period is reduced by the number of days of creditable coverage the enrollee has as of the enrollment date, in accordance with Subsection (4)(b).

(b) (i)  The amount of creditable coverage allowed under Subsection (4)(a)(iii) is determined by counting all the days on which the individual has one or more types of creditable coverage.

(ii)  Days of creditable coverage that occur before a significant break in coverage are not required to be counted.

(A)  Days in a waiting period or affiliation period are not taken into account in determining whether a significant break in coverage has occurred.

(B)  For an individual who elects federal COBRA continuation coverage during the second election period provided under the federal Trade Act of 2002, the days between the date the individual lost group health plan coverage and the first day of the second COBRA election period are not taken into account in determining whether a significant break in coverage has occurred.

(c)  A group health benefit plan may not impose a preexisting condition exclusion relating to pregnancy.
