(2)  shall reinstate an insured in full upon payment of the first premium without the requirement of a waiting period or exclusion for preexisting conditions or any other underwriting requirements that were covered previously; and

(3)  may not increase the insured's premium in excess of what it would have been increased in the normal course of time had the insured not been mobilized into the United States armed forces.
