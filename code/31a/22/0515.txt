31A-22-515.   Nonforfeiture.
If the group life insurance policy is not a term policy, it shall contain
nonforfeiture provisions which the commissioner determines to be equitable to
the insured persons and to the policyholder.  The commissioner may not require
that group life insurance policies contain the same nonforfeiture provisions
which are required for individual life insurance policies.
