31A-22-202.   Protection of third-party claimants.
No insurance contract insuring against loss or damage through legal liability
for the bodily injury or death by accident of any person, or for damage to the
property of any person may be retroactively abrogated to the detriment of any
third-party claimant by any agreement between the insurer and insured after
the occurrence of any injury, death, or damage for which the insured may be
liable.  This attempted abrogation is void.
