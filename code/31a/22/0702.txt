31A-22-702.   Adjustment of premium rate and application of dividends or
rate reductions.
Any group accident and health insurance policy may provide for the adjustment
of the rate of premium based upon the experience under the contract.  If a
policy dividend is declared or a reduction in rate is made or continued for
the first or any subsequent year of insurance under any policy of group
accident and health insurance, the excess, if any, of the aggregate dividends
or rate reductions under the policy and all other group insurance policies of
the policyholder over the aggregate expenditure for insurance under those
policies made from funds contributed by the policyholder, including
expenditures made in connection with the administration of the policies, shall
be applied by the policyholder for the sole benefit of insured employees or
members unless the insured employee or member explicitly elects otherwise.
