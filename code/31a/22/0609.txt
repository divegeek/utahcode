(b)  The insurer has the burden of proving fraud by clear and convincing evidence.

(2)  Except as provided under Section 31A-22-605.1, a claim for loss incurred or disability commencing after two years from the date of issue of the policy may not be reduced or denied on the ground that a disease or physical condition existed prior to the effective date of coverage, unless the condition was excluded from coverage by name or specific description in a provision that was in effect on the date of loss.
