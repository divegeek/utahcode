31A-22-305.3.   Underinsured motorist coverage.

(1)  As used in this section:

(a)  "Covered person" has the same meaning as defined in Section 31A-22-305.

(b) (i)  "Underinsured motor vehicle" includes a motor vehicle, the operation, maintenance, or use of which is covered under a liability policy at the time of an injury-causing occurrence, but which has insufficient liability coverage to compensate fully the injured party for all special and general damages.

(ii)  The term "underinsured motor vehicle" does not include:

(A)  a motor vehicle that is covered under the liability coverage of the same policy that also contains the underinsured motorist coverage;

(B)  an uninsured motor vehicle as defined in Subsection 31A-22-305(2); or

(C)  a motor vehicle owned or leased by:

(I)  a named insured;

(II)  a named insured's spouse; or

(III)  a dependent of a named insured.

(2) (a)  Underinsured motorist coverage under Subsection 31A-22-302(1)(c) provides coverage for a covered person who is legally entitled to recover damages from an owner or operator of an underinsured motor vehicle because of bodily injury, sickness, disease, or death.

(b)  A covered person occupying or using a motor vehicle owned, leased, or furnished to the covered person, the covered person's spouse, or covered person's resident relative may recover underinsured benefits only if the motor vehicle is:

(i)  described in the policy under which a claim is made; or

(ii)  a newly acquired or replacement motor vehicle covered under the terms of the policy.

(3) (a)  For new policies written on or after January 1, 2001, the limits of underinsured motorist coverage shall be equal to the lesser of the limits of the named insured's motor vehicle liability coverage or the maximum underinsured motorist coverage limits available by the insurer under the named insured's motor vehicle policy, unless a named insured rejects or purchases coverage in a lesser amount by signing an acknowledgment form that:

(i)  is filed with the department;

(ii)  is provided by the insurer;

(iii)  waives the higher coverage;

(iv)  need only state in this or similar language that underinsured motorist coverage provides benefits or protection to you and other covered persons for bodily injury resulting from an accident caused by the fault of another party where the other party has insufficient liability insurance; and

(v)  discloses the additional premiums required to purchase underinsured motorist coverage with limits equal to the lesser of the limits of the named insured's motor vehicle liability coverage or the maximum underinsured motorist coverage limits available by the insurer under the named insured's motor vehicle policy.

(b)  Any selection or rejection under Subsection (3)(a) continues for that issuer of the liability coverage until the insured requests, in writing, a change of underinsured motorist coverage from that liability insurer.

(c) (i)  Subsections (3)(a) and (b) apply retroactively to any claim arising on or after January 1, 2001, for which, as of May 14, 2013, an insured has not made a written demand for arbitration or filed a complaint in a court of competent jurisdiction.

(ii)  The Legislature finds that the retroactive application of Subsections (3)(a) and (b) clarifies legislative intent and does not enlarge, eliminate, or destroy vested rights.

(d)  For purposes of this Subsection (3), "new policy" means:

(i)  any policy that is issued which does not include a renewal or reinstatement of an existing policy; or

(ii)  a change to an existing policy that results in:

(A)  a named insured being added to or deleted from the policy; or

(B)  a change in the limits of the named insured's motor vehicle liability coverage.

(e) (i)  As used in this Subsection (3)(e), "additional motor vehicle" means a change that increases the total number of vehicles insured by the policy, and does not include replacement, substitute, or temporary vehicles.

(ii)  The adding of an additional motor vehicle to an existing personal lines or commercial lines policy does not constitute a new policy for purposes of Subsection (3)(d).

(iii)  If an additional motor vehicle is added to a personal lines policy where underinsured motorist coverage has been rejected, or where underinsured motorist limits are lower than the named insured's motor vehicle liability limits, the insurer shall provide a notice to a named insured within 30 days that:

(A)  in the same manner described in Subsection (3)(a)(iv), explains the purpose of underinsured motorist coverage; and

(B)  encourages the named insured to contact the insurance company or insurance producer for quotes as to the additional premiums required to purchase underinsured motorist coverage with limits equal to the lesser of the limits of the named insured's motor vehicle liability coverage or the maximum underinsured motorist coverage limits available by the insurer under the named insured's motor vehicle policy.

(f)  A change in policy number resulting from any policy change not identified under Subsection (3)(d)(ii) does not constitute a new policy.

(g) (i)  Subsection (3)(d) applies retroactively to any claim arising on or after January 1, 2001 for which, as of May 1, 2012, an insured has not made a written demand for arbitration or filed a complaint in a court of competent jurisdiction.

(ii)  The Legislature finds that the retroactive application of Subsection (3)(d):

(A)  does not enlarge, eliminate, or destroy vested rights; and

(B)  clarifies legislative intent.

(h)  A self-insured, including a governmental entity, may elect to provide underinsured motorist coverage in an amount that is less than its maximum self-insured retention under Subsections (3)(a) and(l) by issuing a declaratory memorandum or policy statement from the chief financial officer or chief risk officer that declares the:

(i)  self-insured entity's coverage level; and

(ii)  process for filing an underinsured motorist claim.

(i)  Underinsured motorist coverage may not be sold with limits that are less than:

(i)  $10,000 for one person in any one accident; and

(ii)  at least $20,000 for two or more persons in any one accident.

(j)  An acknowledgment under Subsection (3)(a) continues for that issuer of the underinsured motorist coverage until the named insured, in writing, requests different underinsured motorist coverage from the insurer.

(k) (i)  The named insured's underinsured motorist coverage, as described in Subsection (2), is secondary to the liability coverage of an owner or operator of an underinsured motor vehicle, as described in Subsection (1).

(ii)  Underinsured motorist coverage may not be set off against the liability coverage of the owner or operator of an underinsured motor vehicle, but shall be added to, combined with, or stacked upon the liability coverage of the owner or operator of the underinsured motor vehicle to determine the limit of coverage available to the injured person.

(l) (i)  In conjunction with the first two renewal notices sent after January 1, 2001, for policies existing on that date, the insurer shall disclose in the same medium as the premium renewal notice, an explanation of:

(A)  the purpose of underinsured motorist coverage in the same manner as described in Subsection (3)(a)(iv); and

(B)  a disclosure of the additional premiums required to purchase underinsured motorist coverage with limits equal to the lesser of the limits of the named insured's motor vehicle liability coverage or the maximum underinsured motorist coverage limits available by the insurer under the named insured's motor vehicle policy.

(ii)  The disclosure required under this Subsection (3)(l) shall be sent to all named insureds that carry underinsured motorist coverage limits in an amount less than the named insured's motor vehicle liability policy limits or the maximum underinsured motorist coverage limits available by the insurer under the named insured's motor vehicle policy.

(m)  For purposes of this Subsection (3), a notice or disclosure sent to a named insured in a household constitutes notice or disclosure to all insureds within the household.

(4) (a) (i)  Except as provided in this Subsection (4), a covered person injured in a motor vehicle described in a policy that includes underinsured motorist benefits may not elect to collect underinsured motorist coverage benefits from another motor vehicle insurance policy.

(ii)  The limit of liability for underinsured motorist coverage for two or more motor vehicles may not be added together, combined, or stacked to determine the limit of insurance coverage available to an injured person for any one accident.

(b) (i)  Except as provided in Subsection (4)(b)(ii), a covered person injured while occupying, using, or maintaining a motor vehicle that is not owned, leased, or furnished to the covered person, the covered person's spouse, or the covered person's resident parent or resident sibling, may also recover benefits under any one other policy under which the covered person is also a covered person.

(ii) (A)  A covered person may recover benefits from no more than two additional policies, one additional policy from each parent's household if the covered person is:

(I)  a dependent minor of parents who reside in separate households; and

(II)  injured while occupying or using a motor vehicle that is not owned, leased, or furnished to the covered person, the covered person's resident parent, or the covered person's resident sibling.

(B)  Each parent's policy under this Subsection (4)(b)(ii) is liable only for the percentage of the damages that the limit of liability of each parent's policy of underinsured motorist coverage bears to the total of both parents' underinsured coverage applicable to the accident.

(iii)  A covered person's recovery under any available policies may not exceed the full amount of damages.

(iv)  Underinsured coverage on a motor vehicle occupied at the time of an accident is primary coverage, and the coverage elected by a person described under Subsections 31A-22-305(1)(a) and (b) is secondary coverage.

(v)  The primary and the secondary coverage may not be set off against the other.

(vi)  A covered person as described under Subsection (4)(b)(i) is entitled to the highest limits of underinsured motorist coverage under only one additional policy per household applicable to that covered person as a named insured, spouse, or relative.

(B)  by a law enforcement officer as defined in Section 53-13-103, who is injured within the course and scope of the law enforcement officer's duties.

(5)  The inception of the loss under Subsection 31A-21-313(1) for underinsured motorist claims occurs upon the date of the last liability policy payment.

(6) (a)  Within five business days after notification that all liability insurers have tendered their liability policy limits, the underinsured carrier shall either:

(i)  waive any subrogation claim the underinsured carrier may have against the person liable for the injuries caused in the accident; or

(ii)  pay the insured an amount equal to the policy limits tendered by the liability carrier.

(b)  If neither option is exercised under Subsection (6)(a), the subrogation claim is considered to be waived by the underinsured carrier.
