31A-22-627.   Coverage of emergency medical services.
(1)  A health insurance policy or health maintenance organization contract may
not:
(a)  require any form of preauthorization for treatment of an emergency
medical condition until after the insured's condition has been stabilized; or
(b)  deny a claim for any covered evaluation, covered diagnostic test, or
other covered treatment considered medically necessary to stabilize the
emergency medical condition of an insured.
(2)  A health insurance policy or health maintenance organization contract may
require authorization for the continued treatment of an emergency medical
condition after the insured's condition has been stabilized.  If such
authorization is required, an insurer who does not accept or reject a request
for authorization may not deny a claim for any evaluation, diagnostic testing,
or other treatment considered medically necessary that occurred between the
time the request was received and the time the insurer rejected the request
for authorization.
(3)  For purposes of this section:
(a)  "emergency medical condition" means a medical condition manifesting
itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity, including severe pain, such
that a prudent layperson, who possesses an average knowledge of medicine and
health, would reasonably expect the absence of immediate medical attention at
a hospital emergency department to result in:
(i)  placing the insured's health, or with respect to a pregnant woman, the
health of the woman or her unborn child, in serious jeopardy;
(ii)  serious impairment to bodily functions; or
(iii)  serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part; and
(b)  "hospital emergency department" means that area of a hospital in which
emergency services are provided on a 24-hour-a-day basis.
(4)  Nothing in this section may be construed as:
(a)  altering the level or type of benefits that are provided under the terms
of a contract or policy; or
(b)  restricting a policy or contract from providing enhanced benefits for
certain emergency medical conditions that are identified in the policy or
contract.
