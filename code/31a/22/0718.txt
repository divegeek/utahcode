31A-22-718.   Dependent coverage.

No group policy that provides coverage to children of group members may deny eligibility for coverage to a child solely because the child does not reside with the group member or solely because the child is solely dependent on a former spouse of the group member rather than on the group member.  A child who does not reside with the group member may be excluded on the same basis as children who do reside with the group member.
