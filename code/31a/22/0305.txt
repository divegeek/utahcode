(3)  Uninsured motorist coverage under Subsection 31A-22-302(1)(b) provides coverage for covered persons who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles because of bodily injury, sickness, disease, or death.

(4) (a)  For new policies written on or after January 1, 2001, the limits of uninsured motorist coverage shall be equal to the lesser of the limits of the named insured's motor vehicle liability coverage or the maximum uninsured motorist coverage limits available by the insurer under the named insured's motor vehicle policy, unless a named insured rejects or purchases coverage in a lesser amount by signing an acknowledgment form that:

(i)  is filed with the department;

(ii)  is provided by the insurer;

(iii)  waives the higher coverage;

(iv)  need only state in this or similar language that uninsured motorist coverage provides benefits or protection to you and other covered persons for bodily injury resulting from an accident caused by the fault of another party where the other party has no liability insurance; and

(b)  Any selection or rejection under this Subsection (4) continues for that issuer of the liability coverage until the insured requests, in writing, a change of uninsured motorist coverage from that liability insurer.

(c) (i)  Subsections (4)(a) and (b) apply retroactively to any claim arising on or after January 1, 2001, for which, as of May 14, 2013, an insured has not made a written demand for arbitration or filed a complaint in a court of competent jurisdiction.

(ii)  The Legislature finds that the retroactive application of Subsections (4)(a) and (b) clarifies legislative intent and does not enlarge, eliminate, or destroy vested rights.

(d)  For purposes of this Subsection (4), "new policy" means:

(i)  any policy that is issued which does not include a renewal or reinstatement of an existing policy; or

(ii)  a change to an existing policy that results in:

(B)  a change in the limits of the named insured's motor vehicle liability coverage.

(e) (i)  As used in this Subsection (4)(e), "additional motor vehicle" means a change that increases the total number of vehicles insured by the policy, and does not include replacement, substitute, or temporary vehicles.

(ii)  The adding of an additional motor vehicle to an existing personal lines or commercial lines policy does not constitute a new policy for purposes of Subsection (4)(d).

(iii)  If an additional motor vehicle is added to a personal lines policy where uninsured motorist coverage has been rejected, or where uninsured motorist limits are lower than the named insured's motor vehicle liability limits, the insurer shall provide a notice to a named insured within 30 days that:

(ii)  The Legislature finds that the retroactive application of Subsection (4):

(A)  does not enlarge, eliminate, or destroy vested rights; and

(B)  clarifies legislative intent.

(h)  A self-insured, including a governmental entity, may elect to provide uninsured motorist coverage in an amount that is less than its maximum self-insured retention under Subsections (4)(a) and (5)(a) by issuing a declaratory memorandum or policy statement from the chief financial officer or chief risk officer that declares the:

(i)  self-insured entity's coverage level; and

(ii)  process for filing an uninsured motorist claim.

(i)  Uninsured motorist coverage may not be sold with limits that are less than the minimum bodily injury limits for motor vehicle liability policies under Section 31A-22-304.

(A)  the purpose of uninsured motorist coverage in the same manner as described in Subsection (4)(a)(iv); and

(B)  a disclosure of the additional premiums required to purchase uninsured motorist coverage with limits equal to the lesser of the limits of the named insured's motor vehicle liability coverage or the maximum uninsured motorist coverage limits available by the insurer under the named insured's motor vehicle policy.

(ii)  The disclosure required under Subsection (4)(k)(i) shall be sent to all named insureds that carry uninsured motorist coverage limits in an amount less than the named insured's motor vehicle liability policy limits or the maximum uninsured motorist coverage limits available by the insurer under the named insured's motor vehicle policy.

(l)  For purposes of this Subsection (4), a notice or disclosure sent to a named insured in a household constitutes notice or disclosure to all insureds within the household.

(ii)  This rejection shall be on a form provided by the insurer that includes a reasonable explanation of the purpose of uninsured motorist coverage.

(iii)  This rejection continues for that issuer of the liability coverage until the insured in writing requests uninsured motorist coverage from that liability insurer.

(b) (i)  All persons, including governmental entities, that are engaged in the business of, or that accept payment for, transporting natural persons by motor vehicle, and all school districts that provide transportation services for their students, shall provide coverage for all motor vehicles used for that purpose, by purchase of a policy of insurance or by self-insurance, uninsured motorist coverage of at least $25,000 per person and $500,000 per accident.

(6)  When a covered person alleges that an uninsured motor vehicle under Subsection (2)(b) proximately caused an accident without touching the covered person or the motor vehicle occupied by the covered person, the covered person shall show the existence of the uninsured motor vehicle by clear and convincing evidence consisting of more than the covered person's testimony.

(7) (a)  The limit of liability for uninsured motorist coverage for two or more motor vehicles may not be added together, combined, or stacked to determine the limit of insurance coverage available to an injured person for any one accident.

(b) (i)  Subsection (7)(a) applies to all persons except a covered person as defined under Subsection (8)(b)(ii).

(ii)  A covered person as defined under Subsection (8)(b)(ii) is entitled to the highest limits of uninsured motorist coverage afforded for any one motor vehicle that the covered person is the named insured or an insured family member.
