(i)  referred to in the policy; or

(ii)  owned by a self-insured; and

(d)  any person who is entitled to recover damages against the owner or operator of the uninsured or underinsured motor vehicle because of bodily injury to or death of persons under Subsection (1)(a), (b), or (c).

(2)  As used in this section, "uninsured motor vehicle" includes:

(a) (i)  a motor vehicle, the operation, maintenance, or use of which is not covered under a liability policy at the time of an injury-causing occurrence; or

(ii) (A)  a motor vehicle covered with lower liability limits than required by Section 31A-22-304; and

(B)  the motor vehicle described in Subsection (2)(a)(ii)(A) is uninsured to the extent of the deficiency;

(b)  an unidentified motor vehicle that left the scene of an accident proximately caused by the motor vehicle operator;

(d) (i)  an insured motor vehicle if, before or after the accident, the liability insurer of the motor vehicle is declared insolvent by a court of competent jurisdiction; and

(ii)  the motor vehicle described in Subsection (2)(d)(i) is uninsured only to the extent that the claim against the insolvent insurer is not paid by a guaranty association or fund.

(3)  Uninsured motorist coverage under Subsection 31A-22-302(1)(b) provides coverage for covered persons who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles because of bodily injury, sickness, disease, or death.

(4) (a)  For new policies written on or after January 1, 2001, the limits of uninsured motorist coverage shall be equal to the lesser of the limits of the named insured's motor vehicle liability coverage or the maximum uninsured motorist coverage limits available by the insurer under the named insured's motor vehicle policy, unless a named insured rejects or purchases coverage in a lesser amount by signing an acknowledgment form that:

(i)  is filed with the department;

(ii)  is provided by the insurer;

(iii)  waives the higher coverage;

(iv)  reasonably explains the purpose of uninsured motorist coverage; and

(v)  discloses the additional premiums required to purchase uninsured motorist coverage with limits equal to the lesser of the limits of the named insured's motor vehicle liability coverage or the maximum uninsured motorist coverage limits available by the insurer under the named insured's motor vehicle policy.

(b)  For purposes of this Subsection (4), "new policy" means:

(i)  any policy that is issued which does not include a renewal or reinstatement of an existing policy; or

(ii)  a change to an existing policy that results in:

(A)  a named insured being added to or deleted from the policy; or

(B)  a change in the limits of the named insured's motor vehicle liability coverage.

(c) (i)  As used in this Subsection (4)(c), "additional motor vehicle" means a change that increases the total number of vehicles insured by the policy, and does not include replacement, substitute, or temporary vehicles.

(ii)  The adding of an additional motor vehicle to an existing personal lines or commercial lines policy does not constitute a new policy for purposes of Subsection (4)(b).

(iii)  If an additional motor vehicle is added to a personal lines policy where uninsured motorist coverage has been rejected, or where uninsured motorist limits are lower than the named insured's motor vehicle liability limits, the insurer shall provide a notice to a named insured within 30 days that:

(A)  reasonably explains the purpose of uninsured motorist coverage; and

(B)  encourages the named insured to contact the insurance company or insurance producer for quotes as to the additional premiums required to purchase uninsured motorist coverage with limits equal to the lesser of the limits of the named insured's motor vehicle liability coverage or the maximum uninsured motorist coverage limits available by the insurer under the named insured's motor vehicle policy.

(d)  A change in policy number resulting from any policy change not identified under Subsection (4)(b)(ii) does not constitute a new policy.

(e) (i)  Subsection (4)(b) applies retroactively to any claim arising on or after January 1, 2001 for which, as of May 1, 2012, an insured has not made a written demand for arbitration or filed a complaint in a court of competent jurisdiction.

(ii)  The Legislature finds that the retroactive application of Subsection (4):

(A)  does not enlarge, eliminate, or destroy vested rights; and

(B)  clarifies legislative intent.

(f)  A self-insured, including a governmental entity, may elect to provide uninsured motorist coverage in an amount that is less than its maximum self-insured retention under Subsections (4)(a) and (5)(a) by issuing a declaratory memorandum or policy statement from the chief financial officer or chief risk officer that declares the:

(i)  self-insured entity's coverage level; and

(ii)  process for filing an uninsured motorist claim.

(g)  Uninsured motorist coverage may not be sold with limits that are less than the minimum bodily injury limits for motor vehicle liability policies under Section 31A-22-304.

(h)  The acknowledgment under Subsection (4)(a) continues for that issuer of the uninsured motorist coverage until the named insured requests, in writing, different uninsured motorist coverage from the insurer.

(i) (i)  In conjunction with the first two renewal notices sent after January 1, 2001, for policies existing on that date, the insurer shall disclose in the same medium as the premium renewal notice, an explanation of:

(A)  the purpose of uninsured motorist coverage; and

(B)  a disclosure of the additional premiums required to purchase uninsured motorist coverage with limits equal to the lesser of the limits of the named insured's motor vehicle liability coverage or the maximum uninsured motorist coverage limits available by the insurer under the named insured's motor vehicle policy.

(ii)  The disclosure required under Subsection (4)(i)(i) shall be sent to all named insureds that carry uninsured motorist coverage limits in an amount less than the named insured's motor vehicle liability policy limits or the maximum uninsured motorist coverage limits available by the insurer under the named insured's motor vehicle policy.

(j)  For purposes of this Subsection (4), a notice or disclosure sent to a named insured in a household constitutes notice or disclosure to all insureds within the household.

(5) (a) (i)  Except as provided in Subsection (5)(b), the named insured may reject uninsured motorist coverage by an express writing to the insurer that provides liability coverage under Subsection 31A-22-302(1)(a).

(ii)  This rejection shall be on a form provided by the insurer that includes a reasonable explanation of the purpose of uninsured motorist coverage.

(iii)  This rejection continues for that issuer of the liability coverage until the insured in writing requests uninsured motorist coverage from that liability insurer.

(b) (i)  All persons, including governmental entities, that are engaged in the business of, or that accept payment for, transporting natural persons by motor vehicle, and all school districts that provide transportation services for their students, shall provide coverage for all motor vehicles used for that purpose, by purchase of a policy of insurance or by self-insurance, uninsured motorist coverage of at least $25,000 per person and $500,000 per accident.

(ii)  This coverage is secondary to any other insurance covering an injured covered person.

(c)  Uninsured motorist coverage:

(i)  is secondary to the benefits provided by Title 34A, Chapter 2, Workers' Compensation Act;

(ii)  may not be subrogated by the workers' compensation insurance carrier;

(iii)  may not be reduced by any benefits provided by workers' compensation insurance;

(iv)  may be reduced by health insurance subrogation only after the covered person has been made whole;

(A)  for a person under 18 years of age who is injured within the scope of Subsection (5)(c)(v) but limited to medical and funeral expenses; or

(B)  by a law enforcement officer as defined in Section 53-13-103, who is injured within the course and scope of the law enforcement officer's duties.

(d)  As used in this Subsection (5), "motor vehicle" has the same meaning as under Section 41-1a-102.

(6)  When a covered person alleges that an uninsured motor vehicle under Subsection (2)(b) proximately caused an accident without touching the covered person or the motor vehicle occupied by the covered person, the covered person shall show the existence of the uninsured motor vehicle by clear and convincing evidence consisting of more than the covered person's testimony.

(7) (a)  The limit of liability for uninsured motorist coverage for two or more motor vehicles may not be added together, combined, or stacked to determine the limit of insurance coverage available to an injured person for any one accident.

(b) (i)  Subsection (7)(a) applies to all persons except a covered person as defined under Subsection (8)(b)(ii).

(ii)  A covered person as defined under Subsection (8)(b)(ii) is entitled to the highest limits of uninsured motorist coverage afforded for any one motor vehicle that the covered person is the named insured or an insured family member.

(iii)  This coverage shall be in addition to the coverage on the motor vehicle the covered person is occupying.

(iv)  Neither the primary nor the secondary coverage may be set off against the other.

(c)  Coverage on a motor vehicle occupied at the time of an accident shall be primary coverage, and the coverage elected by a person described under Subsections (1)(a) and (b) shall be secondary coverage.

(8) (a)  Uninsured motorist coverage under this section applies to bodily injury, sickness, disease, or death of covered persons while occupying or using a motor vehicle only if the motor vehicle is described in the policy under which a claim is made, or if the motor vehicle is a newly acquired or replacement motor vehicle covered under the terms of the policy.  Except as provided in Subsection (7) or this Subsection (8), a covered person injured in a motor vehicle described in a policy that includes uninsured motorist benefits may not elect to collect uninsured motorist coverage benefits from any other motor vehicle insurance policy under which the person is a covered person.

(d)  A covered person's recovery under any available policies may not exceed the full amount of damages.

(e)  A covered person in Subsection (8)(b) is not barred against making subsequent elections if recovery is unavailable under previous elections.

(i)  by submitting the claim to binding arbitration; or

(ii)  through litigation.

(b)  Unless otherwise provided in the policy under which uninsured benefits are claimed, the election provided in Subsection (9)(a) is available to the claimant only.

(ii)  If the uninsured motorist carrier, as the moving party in a trial de novo requested under Subsection (9)(o), does not obtain a verdict that is at least 20% less than the arbitration award, the uninsured motorist carrier is responsible for all of the nonmoving party's costs.
