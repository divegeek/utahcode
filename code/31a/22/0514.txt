31A-22-514.   Incontestability.
The group life insurance policy shall contain a provision that the validity of
the policy may not be contested, except for nonpayment of premiums, after it
has been in force for two years from its date of issue. This provision shall
also state that no statement made by any person insured under the policy
relating to his insurability may be used in contesting the validity of the
insurance with respect to which the statement was made after the insurance has
been in force, prior to the contest, for a period of two years during the
person's lifetime, nor may the statement be used unless it is contained in a
written instrument signed by him.  This type of provision does not preclude
the assertion of defenses based upon provisions in the policy which relate to
eligibility for coverage.
