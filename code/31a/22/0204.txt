31A-22-204.   Restriction on limitation of coverage.
No insurer may limit coverage under a policy insuring against legal liability
to claims that are first made against the insured while the policy is in
force, unless the policy contains on the cover page, a conspicuous statement
that the coverage of the policy is limited in that way.
