(2)  The continuation shall be on a premium paying basis until the earlier of:

(a)  six months from the date of total disability;

(b)  approval by the insurer of continuation of the coverage under any disability provision the group insurance policy may contain; or

(c)  the discontinuance of the group insurance policy.

(3)  If the group policy has a waiting period for an accident and health benefit, the continuation extends to the end of the waiting period, even if the group policy is otherwise discontinued.
