31A-18-103.   Protection against currency fluctuations.
Any insurer whose business requires it to make payment in different currencies
may have investments in securities in each of those currencies in an amount
that, independently of all other investments, meets the requirements of the
Insurance Code as applied separately to the insurer's obligations in each
currency.   The commissioner may by order require an insurer, or by rule
require a class of insurers, to maintain these separate currency investments
if the obligations in other currencies are large enough to present a problem
of financial stability if there are substantial fluctuations in relative
currency values.
