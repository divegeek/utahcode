31A-34-109.   Operation of alliances.
An alliance shall:
(1)  be operated by its board;
(2)  contract with at least three insurers unaffiliated with each other to
ensure that enrollees have a choice from among a reasonable number of
competing insurers and types of health benefit plans.  The commissioner may,
by order, modify this requirement to allow an alliance to contract with only
two unaffiliated insurers if the commissioner finds that modification of this
requirement may enhance competitive cost, quality, or access in the pricing
and delivery of health insurance and that such modification does not prejudice
the interests of potential members or enrollees;
(3)  develop standard enrollment procedures;
(4)  prepare and distribute educational materials, plan descriptions, and
comparison sheets describing contracted insurers and the health benefit plans
available through the alliance to prospective members;
(5)  receive, review, and act, as appropriate, on grievances by members and
enrollees;
(6)  establish administrative and accounting procedures for operating the
alliance and for providing services to members and enrollees;
(7)  prepare an annual report for the commissioner on the operations of the
alliance no later than March 1, which shall include an accounting of all
revenues received by the alliance, internal and independent audits, and other
related information as the commissioner may require;
(8)  establish procedures for billing and collecting premiums from members;
(9)  establish procedures that allow an enrollee to transfer at least once
each year to another health benefit plan that is comparable in benefits and is
available through the alliance;
(10)  deposit and maintain all money received and collected for the operation
of the alliance in trust with the clear understanding that the alliance, its
board, employees, and agents have a fiduciary duty to safeguard the money it
receives, pursue funds that are owed, pay outstanding obligations, and account
fully to alliance members and the commissioner; and
(11)  establish marketing standards to be used by contracted insurers.
