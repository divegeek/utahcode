(ii)  A carrier that offers individual and small employer health benefit plans may use the small employer index rates to establish the rate limitations for individual policies, even if some individual policies are rated below the small employer base rate.

(c)  The percentage increase in the premium rate charged to a covered insured for a new rating period, adjusted pro rata for rating periods less than a year, may not exceed the sum of the following:

(i)  the percentage change in the new business premium rate measured from the first day of the prior rating period to the first day of the new rating period;

(ii)  any adjustment, not to exceed 15% annually and adjusted pro rata for rating periods of less than one year, due to the claim experience, health status, or duration of coverage of the covered individuals as determined from the rate manual for the class of business of the carrier offering an individual health benefit plan; and

(iii)  any adjustment due to change in coverage or change in the case characteristics of the covered insured as determined from the rate manual for the class of business of the carrier offering an individual health benefit plan.

(iii)  A carrier offering an individual health benefit plan shall treat all health benefit plans issued or renewed in the same calendar month as having the same rating period.

(e)  For the purposes of this Subsection (1), a health benefit plan that uses a restricted network provision may not be considered similar coverage to a health benefit plan that does not use a restricted network provision, provided that use of the restricted network provision results in substantial difference in claims costs.

(i)  The commissioner shall revise rules issued for Sections 31A-22-602 and 31A-22-605 regarding individual accident and health policy rates to allow rating in accordance with this section.

(2)  For purposes of Subsection (1)(c)(i), if a health benefit product is a health benefit product into which the covered carrier is no longer enrolling new covered insureds, the covered carrier shall use the percentage change in the base premium rate, provided that the change does not exceed, on a percentage basis, the change in the new business premium rate for the most similar health benefit product into which the covered carrier is actively enrolling new covered insureds.

(3) (a)  A covered carrier may not transfer a covered insured involuntarily into or out of a class of business.
