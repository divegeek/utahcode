standards approved by the commissioner; and

member insurer, agrees to forgive the insured of 20% of the debt which
otherwise would be paid by the insurer had it not been insolvent, subject to a
maximum of $8,000 being required to be forgiven by any one provider as to each
claimant.
(ii)  The obligations of a solvent insurer to pay all or part of the covered
claim are not diminished by the forgiveness provided for in this section.

(i)  the amounts that can be assessed under this part are less than the
amounts needed to assure full and prompt performance of the association's
duties under this part; or
(ii)  the economic or financial conditions as they affect member insurers are
sufficiently adverse to render the imposition of the permanent policy or
contract liens to be in the public interest;

policy loans, or any other right to withdraw funds held in conjunction with
policies or contracts, in addition to any contractual provisions for deferral
of cash or policy loan value; and

charge on payment of cash values or policy loans, or on any other right to
