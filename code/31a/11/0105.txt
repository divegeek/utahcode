31A-11-105.   Application of Title 16 -- Incorporation of domestic motor clubs.

Domestic corporations acting or applying to act as a motor club under this chapter are subject to Title 16, Chapter 10a, Utah Revised Business Corporation Act, if for profit, or Title 16, Chapter 6a, Utah Revised Nonprofit Corporation Act, if not for profit.  The Division of Corporations and Commercial Code in the Department of Commerce issues certificates of incorporation for domestic corporations acting as motor clubs under this chapter, unless they are Chapter 5 corporations.  This section does not negate the requirement of a motor club obtaining a certificate of authority from the commissioner. Section 16-6a-301 does not apply to bar a not-for-profit motor club from organizing under Title 16, Chapter 6a, Utah Revised Nonprofit Corporation Act.



Amended by Chapter 300, 2000 General Session
