31A-26-308.   Settlement of liability insurance claim not admission of
liability.
No settlement or partial settlement of a claim against any insured under a
liability insurance policy is an admission, by either the insured or the
insurer, of the liability of the insured on any claim arising from the same
event or set of facts, whether the settlement is made by the insured, the
insurer, or any other person on behalf of the insured or the insurer.
