(ii)  As used in this Subsection (1), "false or misleading information" includes:

(A)  assuring the nonobligatory payment of future dividends or refunds of unused premiums in any specific or approximate amounts, but reporting fully and accurately past experience is not false or misleading information; and

(III)  wilfully refraining from making a proper entry in a record.

(A)  use any business name, slogan, emblem, or related device that is misleading or likely to cause the insurer or other licensee to be mistaken for another insurer or other licensee already in business; or

(v)  A person other than persons licensed as health maintenance organizations under Chapter 8 may not use the term "Health Maintenance Organization" or "HMO" in referring to itself.

(b)  A licensee's violation creates a rebuttable presumption that the violation was also committed by the insurer if:

(A)  that the licensee represents; or

(B)  for whom the licensee processes claims; and

(3) (a)  An insurer may not unfairly discriminate among policyholders by charging different premiums or by offering different terms of coverage, except on the basis of classifications related to the nature and the degree of the risk covered or the expenses involved.

(b)  Rates are not unfairly discriminatory if they are averaged broadly among persons insured under a group, blanket, or franchise policy, and the terms of those policies are not unfairly discriminatory merely because they are more favorable than in similar individual policies.

(4) (a)  This Subsection (4) applies to:

(i)  a person who is or should be licensed under this title;

(ii)  an employee of that licensee or person who should be licensed;

(ii)  A person requiring coverage may reserve the right to disapprove the insurer or the coverage selected on reasonable grounds.

(b)  The form of corporate organization of an insurer authorized to do business in this state is not a reasonable ground for disapproval, and the commissioner may by rule specify additional grounds that are not reasonable.  This Subsection (5) does not bar an insurer from declining an application for insurance.

(6)  A person may not make any charge other than insurance premiums and premium financing charges for the protection of property or of a security interest in property, as a condition for obtaining, renewing, or continuing the financing of a purchase of the property or the lending of money on the security of an interest in the property.
