31A-23a-405.   Insurer liability.
(1)  As used in this section, "insurer" includes bail bond surety companies as
defined in Section 31A-35-102.
(2)  There is a rebuttable presumption that every insurer is bound by any act
of its appointed licensee performed in this state that is within the scope of
the appointed licensee's actual (express or implied) or apparent authority,
until the insurer has canceled the appointed licensee's appointment  and has
made reasonable efforts to recover from the appointed licensee its policy
forms and other indicia of agency.  Reasonable efforts include a formal demand
in writing for return of the indicia, and notice to the commissioner if the
appointed licensee does not promptly comply with the demand.  This Subsection
(2) neither waives any common law defense available to insurers, nor precludes
the insured from seeking redress against the appointed licensee individually
or jointly against the insurer and licensee.
(3)  When a licensee under this chapter with authority to bind more than one
insurer on a particular risk agrees to bind coverage on a particular risk, but
fails to outwardly indicate the insurer with which the risk is placed, and
before the risk is placed with a particular insurer a loss occurs, if there is
no conclusive admissible evidence indicating the insurer with which the
licensee exercised his binding authority, a court may equitably apportion the
loss among all insurers with which the licensee had binding authority as to
the particular type of risk.
