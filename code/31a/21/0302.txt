31A-21-302.   Premiums.
(1)  Subject to Section 31A-21-310 and Subsection 31A-21-106(1), the policy
shall clearly state the amount of the total premium or shall explain in detail
how it is calculated.  Any fee, charge, or other consideration that is not
part of the premium shall be disclosed and explained in writing to the
insured.  The disclosure and explanation shall be clearly stated either on the
policy, or on the insurer's billing to the insured. The premium need not be
contained in a certificate issued under a group policy.  This Subsection (1)
does not preclude premium adjustments or changes upon the renewal or
endorsement of an existing policy.  However, the renewal or endorsement notice
shall contain or be accompanied by a statement of the renewal or endorsement
premium or credit.
(2)  Except as provided in Chapter 23a, Insurance Marketing - Licensing
Producers, Consultants, and Reinsurance Intermediaries, no person may charge
or receive any consideration for the insurance policy which is not stated in
Subsection (1).
(3)  No person may knowingly collect any excessive amount as a premium or any
amount for insurance which is not in the course of processing.  Any amount
unknowingly collected shall be returned immediately on learning of the
mistake.  Prepayment of premiums pursuant to the policy is not an excessive
collection.  Insurance is in the course of processing if an application has
been made for it which is being considered by the insurer, even though it has
not yet been accepted or rejected.
