31A-21-309.   Nonwaiver clause.
An insurer may insert a provision in any insurance policy that no change in
the policy is valid unless approved by an executive officer of the insurer, or
unless the approval is endorsed on the policy or attached to it, or both, and
that no agent has authority to change the policy or waive any of its
provisions.  This does not preclude a person claiming a right under the policy
from relying on waiver or estoppel in an appropriate case.
