(1)  An action on a written policy or contract of first party insurance must
be commenced within three years after the inception of the loss.

applicable to limitation of actions in Title 78B, Chapter 2, Statutes of
Limitations, applies to actions on insurance policies.
(3)  An insurance policy may not:
(a)  limit the time for beginning an action on the policy to a time less than
that authorized by statute;
(b)  prescribe in what court an action may be brought on the policy; or
(c)  provide that no action may be brought, subject to permissible arbitration
provisions in contracts.
(4)  Unless by verified complaint it is alleged that prejudice to the

insurer on an insurance policy to compel payment under the policy until the
earlier of:
(a)  60 days after proof of loss has been furnished as required under the
