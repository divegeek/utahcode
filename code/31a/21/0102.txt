31A-21-102.   Oral contracts of insurance and binders.
(1)  "Binder" means a writing which describes the subject and amount of
insurance and temporarily binds insurance coverage pending the issuance of an
insurance policy.  "Binder" does not include conditional receipts by life
insurance companies under which issuance of the policy or coverage under the
policy is contingent upon the acceptability of the risk to the insurer.
(2)  Binding oral contracts of insurance may only be made as to casualty
insurance, liability insurance, property insurance, vehicle liability
insurance, workers' compensation insurance, and as to combinations of these
coverages.  The insurer shall issue a policy or binder as soon as reasonably
possible after negotiation of any oral contract under this subsection.
(3)  No binder is valid beyond the issuance of the policy as to which the
binder was given, or beyond 150 days from the binder's effective date,
whichever occurs first.
(4)  If a policy has not been issued as to a binder, the binder may be
extended or renewed beyond 150 days, but only upon the commissioner's written
approval, or under rules adopted by the commissioner.
(5)  A binder may be cancelled by the insurer prior to its expiration date
only in the same manner as and subject to the same restrictions that apply to
insurance policies under Section 31A-21-303.
