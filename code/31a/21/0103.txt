31A-21-103.   Capacity to contract.
Any person 16 years of age or older who is otherwise competent to contract
under Utah law, and who is not subject to any legal disability, may contract
for insurance.  If there is a conservator appointed under Title 75, the
conservator, rather than the person whose property is subject to the
conservatorship, may contract for insurance to protect the property under
conservatorship.  In the case of a conservatorship over the person or property
of a person under 16 years of age, the conservator may invest funds of the
estate in life or accident and health insurance or annuity contracts, but only
with the approval of the court having jurisdiction over the conservatorship.
