31A-21-503.   Discrimination based on domestic violence or child abuse
prohibited.
(1)  Except as provided in Subsection (2), an insurer of life or accident and
health insurance may not consider whether an insured or applicant is the
subject of domestic abuse as a factor to:
(a)  refuse to insure the applicant;
(b)  refuse to continue to insure the insured;
(c)  refuse to renew or reissue a policy to insure the insured or applicant;
(d)  limit the amount, extent, or kind of coverage available to the insured or
applicant;
(e)  charge a different rate for coverage to the insured or applicant;
(f)  exclude or limit benefits or coverage under an insurance policy or
contract for losses incurred;
(g)  deny a claim; or
(h)  terminate coverage or fail to provide conversion privileges in violation
of Sections 31A-22-612 and 31A-22-723 under a group accident and health policy
for the insured because the coverage was issued in the name of the perpetrator
of the domestic violence or abuse.
(2) (a)  Notwithstanding Subsection (1), an insurer may underwrite on the
basis of the physical or mental condition of an insured or applicant if the
underwriting is on the basis of a determination that there is a correlation
between the medical or mental condition and a material increase in insurance
risk.
(b)  For purposes of Subsection (2)(a), the fact that an insured or applicant
is a subject of domestic abuse is not a mental or physical condition.
(c)  The determination required by Subsection (2)(a) shall be made in
conformance with sound actuarial principles.
(d)  Within 30 days after receiving an oral or written request from an insured
or applicant, an insurer shall disclose in writing:
(i)  the basis of an action permitted under Subsection (2)(a); and
(ii)  if the policy has been issued or modified, the extent the action taken
will impact the amount, extent, or kind of coverage or benefits available to
the insured.
