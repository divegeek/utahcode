31A-36-110.   Payment and document requirements.
(1) (a)  A life settlement provider shall instruct the owner to send the
executed documents required to effect the change in ownership or assignment or
change of beneficiary of the affected policy to a designated independent
escrow agent.
(b)  Within three business days after the day on which the escrow agent
receives the documents, or within three business days after the day on which
the life settlement provider receives the documents if by mistake they are
sent directly to the life settlement provider, the life settlement provider
shall deposit the proceeds of the life settlement into an escrow or trust
account of the escrow agent in a federally insured depository institution.
(2) (a)  Upon completion of the requirements of Subsection (1), the escrow
agent shall deliver the original documents executed by the owner to:
(i)  the life settlement provider; or
(ii)  a related provider trust or other designated representative of the life
settlement provider.
(b)  Upon the life settlement provider's receipt from the insurer of an
acknowledgment of the change in ownership or assignment or change of
beneficiary of the affected policy, the life settlement provider shall
instruct the escrow agent to pay the proceeds of the life settlement to the
owner.
(3)  Payment to the owner must be made within three business days after the
day on which the life settlement provider receives the acknowledgment from the
insurer.  Failure to make the payment within that time makes the life
settlement voidable by the owner for lack of consideration until payment is
tendered to and accepted by the owner.
