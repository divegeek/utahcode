31A-5-507.   Conversion of assessable to nonassessable and nonassessable to
assessable mutuals.
(1)  When an assessable mutual accumulates enough surplus to satisfy the
financial requirements for the operation of a nonassessable mutual, it may
apply for a certificate of authority authorizing it to sell nonassessable
policies.  The commissioner shall issue a certificate of authority designating
it a nonassessable mutual, if he finds that the applicant satisfies the
requirements of the law and that the issuance of nonassessable policies will
not endanger the interests of its insureds or the public.  Policies issued
after the issuance of this certificate of authority are nonassessable.
Existing policies remain in effect and are nonassessable.
(2)  A nonassessable mutual may apply to the commissioner for a certificate of
authority designating it an assessable mutual.  The commissioner shall issue
the certificate if the law permits the corporation to issue assessable
policies and if he finds that the conversion will not endanger the interests
of insureds or the public.  All policies issued after conversion are
assessable, unless otherwise provided by contract.
