(b)  If, after July 1, 1986, an insurer ever has minimum capital or permanent surplus that meets or exceeds the requirements of Subsections (2) and (3), then Subsection (4)(a) is inapplicable to that insurer and it shall comply with Subsections (2) and (3).

(5) (a) (i)  An assessable mutual may be organized under this chapter, but it may not issue life insurance or annuities.

(ii)  An assessable mutual need not have a permanent surplus if the assessment liability of its policyholders is unlimited and all insurance policies clearly state that.

(iii)  If assessments are limited to a specified amount or a specified multiple of annual advance premiums, the minimum permanent surplus is the amount that would be required under Subsections (2) and (3) if the corporation were not assessable, reduced by an amount that reasonably reflects the value of the policyholders' assessment liability in satisfying the financial needs of the corporation.

(iv)  The liability of members in an assessable mutual is joint and several up to the limits provided by:

(A)  the articles of incorporation of the assessable mutual; or

(B)  this title.

(b) (i)  Except as provided in Subsections (5)(c) and (d), a certificate of authority may not be issued to an assessable mutual until it has at least 400 bona fide applications for insurance from not less than 400 separate applicants, on separate risks located in this state, in each of the classes of business upon which assessments may be separately levied.  A full year's premium shall be paid with each application and the aggregate premium is at least $50,000 for each class.

(ii)  If at any time while the corporation is an assessable mutual, the business plan is amended to include an additional class of business on which assessments may be separately levied, identical requirements of Subsection (5)(b)(i) are applicable to each additional class.

(c)  Five or more employers may join in the formation of an assessable mutual to write only workers' compensation insurance if, instead of the requirements of Subsection (5)(b), policies are simultaneously put into effect that cover at least 1,500 employees, with no single employer having more than 1/5 of the employees insured by the assessable mutual.  A full year's premium shall be paid by each employer, aggregating at least $200,000.

(d) (i)  The number and amount of required initial applications and premium payments may be reduced by substituting surplus for the applications or premium payments.

(ii)  The commissioner shall determine the reduction in required initial applications and premium payments that is appropriate for a given amount of surplus.
