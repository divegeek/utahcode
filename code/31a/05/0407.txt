31A-5-407.   Board of directors.

(1)  Subject to this section, Sections 16-10a-801 through 16-10a-803, 16-10a-805, and 16-10a-811 apply to the board of directors of a stock corporation and Sections 16-6a-802 and 16-6a-805 apply to the governing board and trustees of mutuals.

(2)  A majority of the directors shall be residents of this state unless the commissioner is satisfied that the corporation's financial condition, management, and other circumstances give assurance that the interests of insureds and the public will not be endangered by the majority being nonresidents.

(3)  Employees and agents of a corporation that receive more than 10% of their income from the corporation, and persons related to any of them within the second degree by blood or marriage, if directors, are considered "inside directors."  Inside directors may not constitute a majority of the corporation's board.

(4)  Subsections (2) and (3) and the required number of directors for committees under Subsection 31A-5-412(1) do not apply to an insurance subsidiary authorized under Subsection 31A-5-218(1), nor to a stock insurance corporation, more than 50% of whose outstanding shares entitled to vote are owned or controlled by a single person or all of whose voting shareholders are either members of or are individually represented on the board.

Subject to this requirement, Section 16-10a-804 applies to the classification of directors of stock corporations.  When classes of trustees or directors are provided in a mutual corporation, the terms of office of the several classes need not be uniform.
