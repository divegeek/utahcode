31A-5-414.   Transactions in which directors and others are interested.
(1)  Any material transaction between an insurance corporation and one or more
of its directors or officers, or between an insurance corporation and any
other person in which one or more of its directors or officers or any person
controlling the corporation has a material interest, is voidable by the
corporation unless all the following exist:
(a)  At the time the transaction is entered into it is fair to the interests
of the corporation.
(b)  The transaction has, with full knowledge of its terms and of the
interests involved, been approved in advance by the board or by the
shareholders.
(c)  The transaction has been reported to the commissioner immediately after
approval by the board or the shareholders.
(2)  A director, whose interest or status makes the transaction subject to
this section, may be counted in determining a quorum for a board meeting
approving a transaction under Subsection (1) (b), but may not vote.  Approval
requires the affirmative vote of a majority of those present.
(3)  The commissioner may by rule exempt certain types of transactions from
the reporting requirement of Subsection (1) (c).  The commissioner has
standing to bring an action on behalf of an insurer to have a contract in
violation of Subsection (1) declared void.  Such an action shall be brought in
the Third Judicial District Court for Salt Lake County.
