31A-5-109.   Compliance extension.
If timely adjustment to a particular requirement applicable to a Chapter 5
mutual would cause a former county mutual, reciprocal insurer, cooperative
association, or mutual benefit association hardship, disproportionate expense,
or serious inconvenience, the commissioner may, upon the insurer's request,
grant an extension for compliance if the interests of insureds and the public
are not endangered.  This extension may not be beyond July 1, 1988.  The
requirement of payment of taxes and fees is not considered a hardship or a
disproportionate expense.
