31A-15-105.   Effect of contracts illegal because insurer was unauthorized.
(1)  An insurance contract entered into in violation of this chapter is
unenforceable by, but enforceable against, the insurer.  In an action against
the insurer on the contract, the insured is bound by the terms of the contract
as affected by this title and rules adopted under this title.
(2)  An insurance policy entered into in violation of this chapter is voidable
by the policyholder who entered into the transaction without knowing it was
illegal.  The policyholder may avoid the contract by notice to the insurer, if
no insured has enforced the contract by an action under Subsection (1), and
may recover any consideration paid under the contract.
(3)  Any person who assisted in the procurement of an illegal contract under
this chapter, and who knew or should have known the transaction was illegal,
is liable to the insured for the full amount of a claim or loss payable under
the contract, if the insurer does not pay it. The receiver appointed under
Chapter 27a, Insurer Receivership Act, may assert the claims of insureds if
the insurer is the subject of a proceeding under Chapter 27a.
