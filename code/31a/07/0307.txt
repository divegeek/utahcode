(a)  compensation or indemnification of any person who is a director, principal officer, or one of the three most highly paid employees, and any benefits or payments requiring shareholder or policyholder approval;

(b)  approval of any contract required to be approved by the board under Section 31A-7-309 or of any other transaction in which a director has a material interest adverse to the corporation;
