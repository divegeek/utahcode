(2) (a)  If there is a default in an executory contract or unexpired lease of the insurer, the receiver may not assume the contract or lease unless, at the time of the assumption of the contract or lease, the receiver:

(i)  cures or provides adequate assurance that the receiver will promptly cure the default; and

(ii)  provides adequate assurance of future performance under the contract or lease.
