(3)  Without derogating from Section 31A-27a-512, if the liquidator is unable to negotiate a voluntary commutation with a reinsurer with respect to a reinsurance agreement between the insurer and that reinsurer, the liquidator may, in addition to any other remedy available under applicable law, apply to the receivership court, with notice to the reinsurer, for an order requiring that the parties submit commutation proposals with respect to the reinsurance agreement to a panel of three arbitrators:

(a)  at any time after 75% of the actuarially estimated ultimate incurred liability for all of the casualty claims against the liquidation estate is reached by allowance of claims in the liquidation estate pursuant to Sections 31A-27a-603 and 31A-27a-605, calculated:

(B)  accompany the award issued by the arbitration panel pursuant to Subsection (8).

(d)  The cost of the expert is to be paid equally by the parties.

(7)  Within 90 days after the day on which the disinterested arbitrator is appointed under Subsection (5), each party shall submit to the arbitration panel:

(b)  other documents and information relevant to the determination of the parties' rights and obligations under the reinsurance agreement to be commuted, including:

(i)  a written review of any disputed paid claim balances;

(i)  shall issue an award, determined by a majority of the arbitration panel, specifying the terms of a commercially reasonable and actuarially sound commutation agreement between the parties; or

(ii)  may issue an award declining commutation between the parties for a period not to exceed two years if a majority of the arbitration panel determines that it is unable to derive a commercially reasonable and actuarially sound commutation on the basis of:

(A)  the submissions of the parties; and

(B)  if applicable, the report and recommendation of the expert retained in accordance with Subsection (6).

(b)  Following the expiration of the two-year period described in Subsection (8)(a), the liquidator may again invoke arbitration in accordance with Subsection (2), in which event Subsections (2) through (9) apply to the renewed proceeding, except that the arbitration panel is obliged to issue an award under Subsection (8)(a).

(9)  Once an award is issued, the liquidator shall promptly submit the award to the receivership court for confirmation.

(10) (a)  Within 30 days of the day on which the receivership court confirms the award, the reinsurer shall give notice to the receiver that the reinsurer:

(i)  will commute the reinsurer's liabilities to the insurer for the amount of the award in return for a full and complete release of all liabilities between the parties, whether past, present, or future; or

(ii)  will not commute the reinsurer's liabilities to the insurer.

(b)  If the reinsurer's liabilities are not commuted under Subsection (10)(a), the reinsurer shall:

(i)  establish and maintain in accordance with Section 31A-27a-516 a reinsurance recoverable trust in the amount of 102% of the award; and

(ii)  pay the costs and fees associated with establishing and maintaining the trust established under this Subsection (10)(b).

(11) (a)  If the reinsurer notifies the liquidator that it will commute the reinsurer's liabilities pursuant to Subsection (10)(a)(i), the liquidator has 30 days from the day on which the reinsurer notifies the liquidator to:

(i)  tender to the reinsurer a proposed commutation and release agreement:

(A)  providing for a full and complete release of all liabilities between the parties, whether past, present, or future; and

(a)  upon the consent of the parties; or

(b)  by order of the receivership court, for good cause shown.

(13)  Subject to Subsection (14), this section may not be construed to supersede or impair any provision in a reinsurance agreement that establishes a commercially reasonable and actuarially sound method for valuing and commuting the obligations of the parties to the reinsurance agreement by providing in the contract the specific methodology to be used for valuing and commuting the obligations between the parties.

(14) (a)  A commutation provision in a reinsurance agreement is not effective if it is demonstrated to the receivership court that the provision is entered into in contemplation of the insolvency of one or more of the parties.

(b)  A contractual commutation provision entered into within one year of the day on which the liquidation order of the insurer is entered is rebuttably presumed to have been entered into in contemplation of insolvency.
