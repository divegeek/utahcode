(1)  Notwithstanding the entry of a liquidation order, the liquidator may
apply for an order to sell or dissolve the corporate entity or charter of a
domestic insurer, or the United States branch of an alien insurer domiciled in
this state:
(a)  at any time after an order of liquidation of the insurer is granted; and
(b)  consistent with this section.
(2)  Upon an application to sell the corporate entity or charter, with notice
as prescribed in this chapter, the receivership court may enter an order:
(a)  separating the corporate entity or charter, together with any of its
licenses to do business and the assets the liquidator considers appropriate to
the transaction, from:
(i)  the remaining estate in liquidation;
(ii)  all of the remaining estate's assets; and
(iii)  the claims or interests of all claimants, creditors, policyholders, and
stockholders;
(b)  canceling all outstanding stock and other securities of, and other equity
interests in, the corporate entity or charter, except that the cancellation
may not affect any claim against the estate by holders of the equity
interests;
(c)  authorizing the issuance and sale of new stock or other securities for
the purpose of transferring to one or more buyers control and ownership of the
corporate entity or charter; and
(d)  authorizing the sale of the corporate entity or charter, together with
any of its licenses to do business and the general assets the liquidator
considers appropriate to the transaction, free and clear from the claims or
interests of all claimants, creditors, policyholders, and stockholders.
(3) (a)  The sale of the corporate entity or charter may be made in the manner
and on the terms and conditions:
(i)  applied for by the liquidator; and
(ii)  ordered by the receivership court.
(b)  A sale is subject to the domiciliary state's laws regarding acquisition
of an insurer under Chapter 16, Insurance Holding Companies.
(c)  Upon the sale of a corporate entity or chapter:
(i)  the proceeds from the sale become a part of the property of the estate in
liquidation; and
(ii)  the then separate corporate entity or charter, together with any of its
licenses to do business and the assets the liquidator considers appropriate to
the transaction, is free and clear from the claims or interests of all
claimants, creditors, policyholders, and stockholders of the insurer in
liquidation.
(d)  The court has broad powers to effect the disposition of a corporate
entity and its charter including, without limiting the statement of broad
powers, a reorganization or conversion of the corporate entity.
(4)  This section shall be liberally construed to:
(a)  accomplish its purposes to provide an expeditious and effective procedure
to realize the maximum proceeds possible from the sale of a corporate entity
or charter separated from an estate in liquidation; and
(b)  ensure that a purchaser receives clear and marketable title.
(5)  If permission to sell the corporate entity or charter is not granted
before discharge of the liquidator, in accordance with this section or
otherwise with receivership court approval:
(a)  the receivership court may order dissolution of the corporate entity or
charter;
(b)  dissolution is considered complete by operation of law upon the discharge
of the liquidator if the insurer is insolvent; or
(c)  dissolution may be ordered by the receivership court upon the discharge
of the liquidator if the insurer is under a liquidation order for some other
reason.
