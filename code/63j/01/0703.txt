63J-1-703.   Selection of activities for review -- Coordination with audits.
The legislative auditor general shall consult with the Legislative Management
Committee to determine the programs or activities to audit which will best
assist the executive branch in preparing the in-depth budget and the
Legislature in reviewing the in-depth budget for funding.  The scope of the
audits shall be determined by the legislative auditor general based upon need,
manpower considerations, and other audit priorities.  It is the intent of the
Legislature that the legislative fiscal analyst and the legislative auditor
general coordinate the in-depth budget reviews insofar as possible with the
audits performed by the legislative auditor general.
