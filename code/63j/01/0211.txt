63J-1-211.    Appropriating from restricted accounts.

(1)  As used in this section, "operating deficit" means that estimated General Fund or Uniform School Fund revenues are less than budgeted for the current or next fiscal year.

(2)  Notwithstanding any other statute that limits the Legislature's power to appropriate from a restricted account, if the Legislature determines that an operating deficit exists, unless prohibited by federal law or court order, the Legislature may, in eliminating the deficit, appropriate money from a restricted account into the General Fund.
