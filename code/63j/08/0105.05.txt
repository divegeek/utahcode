(3)  The state finds that:

(a)  the lands comprising the Uintah Basin Energy Zone contain abundant, world-class deposits of energy and mineral resources, including oil, natural gas, oil shale, oil sands, gilsonite, coal, phosphate, gold, uranium, and copper, as well as areas with high wind and solar energy potential; and

(b)  the highest management priority for all lands within the Uintah Basin Energy Zone is responsible management and development of existing energy and mineral resources in order to provide long-term domestic energy and supplies for Utah and the United States.

(5)  The state calls upon the federal agencies who administer lands within the Uintah Basin Energy Zone to:

(a)  fully cooperate and coordinate with the state and with Daggett, Uintah, and Duchesne Counties to develop, amend, and implement land and resource management plans and to implement management decisions that are consistent with the purposes, goals, and policies described in this section to the maximum extent allowed under federal law;

(b)  expedite the processing, granting, and streamlining of mineral and energy leases and applications to drill, extract, and otherwise develop all existing energy and mineral resources located within the Uintah Basin Energy Zone, including oil, natural gas, oil shale, oil sands, gilsonite, phosphate, gold, uranium, copper, solar, and wind resources;

(c)  allow continued maintenance and increased development of roads, power lines, pipeline infrastructure, and other utilities necessary to achieve the goals, purposes, and policies described in this section;

(d)  refrain from any planning decisions and management actions that will undermine, restrict, or diminish the goals, purposes, and policies for the Uintah Basin Energy Zone as stated in this section; and
