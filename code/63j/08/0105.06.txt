(5)  The state requests that the federal agencies that administer lands within the Escalante Region Grazing Zone:

(7)  Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the state's mineral, oil, gas, and energy policies and plans on land within the Escalante Region Grazing Zone shall continue to be governed by Sections 63J-4-401 and 63J-8-104.
