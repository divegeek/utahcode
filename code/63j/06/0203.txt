-- Income.
(1)  There is created a restricted account within the General Fund known as
the "Tax and Revenue Anticipation Note Redemption Account."  When any notes
have been issued in anticipation of income or revenue under this chapter, not
less than two days before the principal and interest on the notes comes due,
income or revenue realized from the tax or nontax sources specified in the
approved plan of financing to be anticipated or from any other source of money
legally available for such purpose shall be placed in the restricted account
so that the amount in the restricted account is sufficient to pay the
principal amount of all notes outstanding, together with interest on them.
(2)  The money in the restricted account is appropriated solely for the
payment of the principal of and interest on the notes issued under this
chapter.  The payment of the principal and interest on the notes issued under
this chapter is not limited solely to the income and revenues from the
specific tax or nontax sources in anticipation of which the notes were issued.
Accrued interest received upon the sale of the notes shall be deposited by the
state treasurer in the restricted account.
(3)  The state treasurer may invest all money in the restricted account in
accordance with Title 51, Chapter 7, State Money Management Act, maturing at a
time which will permit payment of the principal of and interest on the notes
in a timely manner when due.  The state treasurer may covenant with the
purchasers of the notes as to the manner of holding money in the restricted
account, the investment of money in the restricted account, and the
disposition of any investment income therefrom by retaining investment income
in the restricted account to be used to pay principal of and interest on notes
when due or by paying the investment income to the state treasurer for deposit
into the General Fund.  If there is sufficient money in the restricted account
to pay all principal of and interest on all outstanding notes payable
therefrom, all investment income on it shall be paid to the state treasurer
for deposit into the General Fund.
