(ii)  subject to the limits established in Subsection 63M-1-2404(3)(c), seek to modify those agreements for the sole purpose of providing the incentives in the form of tax credits under this part rather than partial rebates.

(c)  The office shall:

(i)  for each modified agreement granting tax credits, follow the procedures and requirements of Section 63M-1-2405; and

(ii)  for each agreement that still requires the state to pay partial rebates to the business entity, follow the procedures and requirements of this section.

(b)  Within 90 days of the end of each calendar year, a business entity seeking a partial rebate shall:

(i)  provide the office with documentation of the new state revenues that the business entity generated during the preceding calendar year; and

(ii)  ensure that the documentation includes:

(A)  the types of taxes and corresponding amounts of taxes paid directly to the State Tax Commission; and

(C)  any other information requested by the Division of Finance.

(5)  Upon receipt of a request for payment of partial rebates from the office, the Division of Finance shall:

(b)  notwithstanding Subsections 51-5-3(23)(b) and 63J-1-104(3)(c), after receiving a request for payment of partial rebates and making the transfer required by Subsection (5)(a), the Division of Finance shall pay the partial rebates from the account.
