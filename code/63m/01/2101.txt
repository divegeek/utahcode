state, and local governments.
(1)  The Legislature recognizes that:
(a)  many Utah companies provide products and services which are routinely
procured by a myriad of governmental entities at all levels of government, but
that attempting to understand and comply with the numerous certification,
registration, proposal, and contract requirements associated with government
procurement often raises significant barriers for those companies with no
government contracting experience;
(b)  the costs associated with obtaining a government contract for products or
services often prevent most small businesses from working in the governmental
procurement market;
(c)  currently a majority of federal procurement opportunities are contracted
to businesses located outside of the state;
(d)  the Governor's Office of Economic Development currently administers
programs and initiatives that help create and grow companies in Utah and
recruit companies to Utah through the use of state employees, public-private
partnerships, and contractual services; and

business with federal, state, and local governments.

governmental contracts;

private grants for projects and programs that:

revenues by helping these companies secure new business with federal, state,
and local governments;

with federal, state, and local governmental entities;
(iii)  would facilitate marketing, business development, and expansion
opportunities for Utah companies in cooperation with the Governor's Office of

commerce, trade associations, or private contractors as determined by the
office's director to successfully match Utah businesses with government
procurement opportunities; and

(A)  recruitment, individualized consultation, and an introduction to
government contracting;
