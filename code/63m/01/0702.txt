63M-1-702.   Purpose.
(1) (a)  The Legislature recognizes that the growth of new industry and
expansion of existing industry requires a strong technology base, new ideas,
concepts, innovations, and prototypes.
(b)  These generally come from strong research colleges and universities.
(c)  Technical research in Utah's colleges and universities should be enhanced
and expanded, particularly in those areas targeted by the state for economic
development.
(d)  Most states are enhancing their research base by direct funding, usually
on a matching basis.
(e)  The purpose of this part is to catalyze and enhance the growth of these
technologies by encouraging interdisciplinary research activities in targeted
areas and by facilitating the transition of these technologies out of the
university environment into industry where the technologies can be used to
enhance job creation.
(f)  The Legislature recognizes that one source of funding is in matching
state funds with federal funds and industrial support to provide the needed
new technologies.
(2)  The Legislature recommends that the governor consider the allocation of
economic development funds for Centers of Excellence to be matched by industry
and federal grants on at least a two-for-one basis for colleges and
universities in the state that offer any doctoral degrees.
(3) (a)  The Legislature recommends that the funds be allocated on a
competitive basis to the various colleges and universities in the state and to
companies working in partnership with colleges and universities to
commercialize their technologies.
(b)   The funds made available should be used to support interdisciplinary
research in specialized Centers of Excellence in technologies that are
considered to have potential for economic development in this state and to
help transition these technologies out of the colleges and universities into
industry.
