(1)  The claims procedures shall be sufficiently simple that the assistance of an attorney is unnecessary, and no attorney fees shall be paid for the assistance of an attorney or any other representative in filing the claim or providing information to the reparations officer.

(2)  Attorney fees may be granted in the following circumstances and shall be paid out of the reparations award not to exceed 15% of the amount of the reparations award:

(a)  when an award has been denied and, after a hearing, the decision to deny is overturned; or

(b)  when minor dependents of a deceased victim require assistance in establishing a trust or determining a guardian.

(3)  An attorney or any other person providing assistance in a reparations claim, who contracts for or receives sums not allowed under this chapter, is guilty of a class B misdemeanor.  This provision shall not extend to attorneys who assist the victim in filing a civil action against the perpetrator.
