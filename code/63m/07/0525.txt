63M-7-525.   Purpose -- Not entitlement program.

(1)  The purpose of the Utah Office for Victims of Crime is to assist victims of criminally injurious conduct who may be eligible for assistance from the Crime Victim Reparations Fund.  Reparation to a victim is limited to the money available in the fund.

(2)  This program is not an entitlement program.  Awards may be limited or denied as determined appropriate by the board.  Failure to grant an award does not create a cause of action against the Utah Office for Victims of Crime, the state, or any of its subdivisions.  There is no right to judicial review over the decision whether or not to grant an award.

(3)  A cause of action based on a failure to give or receive the notice required by this chapter does not accrue to any person against the state, any of its agencies or local subdivisions, any of their law enforcement officers or other agents or employees, or any health care or medical provider or its agents or employees.  The failure does not affect or alter any requirement for filing or payment of a claim.
