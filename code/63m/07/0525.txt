There is no right to judicial review over the decision whether or not to grant an award.

(3)  A cause of action based on a failure to give or receive the notice required by this chapter does not accrue to any person against the state, any of its agencies or local subdivisions, any of their law enforcement officers or other agents or employees, or any health care or medical provider or its agents or employees.  The failure does not affect or alter any requirement for filing or payment of a claim.
