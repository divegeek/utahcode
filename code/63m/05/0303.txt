63M-5-303.   Public facility -- Prepayment of sales and use tax in
installments.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this chapter, prepaid
sales or use taxes sufficient to construct a particular public facility need
not be prepaid in one sum but may be prepaid in installments as may be
required by the state or any of its agencies or political subdivisions in
fulfilling contractual commitments for the construction of the public facility
if the state receives assurance that the funds for the agreed project will be
prepaid to the State Tax Commission at the time or times for which the state
or any of its agencies or political subdivisions have made contractual
commitments for the disbursement of these funds for the public facility.  In
no event shall the total accumulated prepayment be less than the amount of
sales and use taxes due for the calendar quarters for which returns are
required to be filed under Section 59-12-107.
