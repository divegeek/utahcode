64-9b-1.   Legislative findings.
(1)  The Legislature finds that it is in the best interest of the state of
Utah for the department to:
(a)  develop job opportunities to further enhance the rehabilitation of
inmates of the Utah state prison;
(b)  establish and actively work toward the goal that all inmates shall be
productively involved in a treatment, education, or work program, or a
combination of these programs, as appropriate, except for inmates who the
department determines are physically or mentally disabled, or pose a danger to
the public, so that they are unable to engage in these activities; and
(c)  submit a comprehensive management plan outlining the department's plan to
meet this goal to the Legislature on or before November 1 of each even-
numbered year, and the plan shall include:
(i)  a cost-effective analysis of current inmate education, treatment, and
work programs; and
(ii)  a study of the feasibility of expanding inmate work programs,
particularly in regard to programs that:
(A)  are not capital intensive;
(B)  do not unfairly compete with existing Utah industry; and
(C)  are designed to increase the motivation, develop the work capabilities,
and foster the cooperation of inmates.
(2)  The Legislature further finds that a proper means to accomplish this is
through a liberal application of this act.
