"Victim" includes the legal guardian of a victim, or the representative of the family of a victim who is deceased.

(2) (a)  A victim shall be notified of an offender's release under Sections 64-13-14.5 and 64-13-14.7, or any other release to or from a half-way house, to a program outside of the prison such as a rehabilitation program, state hospital, community center other than a release on parole, commutation or termination for which notice is provided under Sections 77-27-9.5 and 77-27-9.7, transfer of the offender to an out-of-state facility, or an offender's escape, upon submitting a signed written request of notification to the Department of Corrections.
