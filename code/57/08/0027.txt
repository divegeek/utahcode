57-8-27.   Separate taxation.
(1)  Each unit and its percentage of undivided interest in the common or
community areas and facilities shall be considered to be a parcel and shall be
subject to separate assessment and taxation by each assessing unit, local
district, and special service district for all types of taxes authorized by
law, including ad valorem levies and special assessments.  Neither the
building or buildings, the property, nor any of the common areas and
facilities may be considered a parcel.
(2)  In the event any of the interests in real property made subject to this
chapter by the declaration are leasehold interests, if the lease creating
these interests is of record in the office of the county recorder, if the
balance of the term remaining under the lease is at least 40 years at the time
the leasehold interest is made subject to this chapter, if units are situated
or are to be situated on or within the real property covered by the lease, and
if the lease provides that the lessee shall pay all taxes and assessments
imposed by governmental authority, then until 10 years prior to the date that
the leasehold is to expire or until the lease is terminated, whichever first
occurs, all taxes and assessments on the real property covered by the lease
shall be levied against the owner of the lessee's interest.  If the owner of
the reversion under the lease has executed the declaration and condominium
plat, until 10 years prior to the date that the leasehold is to expire, or
until the lease is terminated, whichever first occurs, all taxes and
assessments on the real property covered by the lease shall be separately
levied against the unit owners having an interest in the lease, with each unit
owner for taxation purposes being considered the owner of a parcel consisting
of his undivided condominium interest in the fee of the real property affected
by the lease.
(3)  No forfeiture or sale of the improvements or the property as a whole for
delinquent real estate taxes, special assessments, or charges shall divest or
in anywise affect the title to an individual unit if the real estate taxes or
duly levied share of the assessments and charges on the individual unit are
currently paid.
(4)  Any exemption from taxes that may exist on real property or the ownership
of the property may not be denied by virtue of the submission of the property
to this chapter.
(5)  Timeshare interests and timeshare estates, as defined in Subsection
57-19-2(17), may not be separately taxed but shall be valued, assessed, and
taxed at the unit level.  The value of timeshare interests and timeshare
estates, for purposes of ad valorem taxation, shall be determined by valuing
the real property interest associated with the timeshare interest or timeshare
estate, exclusive of the value of any intangible property and rights
associated with the acquisition, operation, ownership, and use of the
timeshare interest or timeshare estate, including the fees and costs
associated with the sale of timeshare interests and timeshare estates that
exceed those fees and costs normally incurred in the sale of other similar
properties, the fees and costs associated with the operation, ownership, and
use of timeshare interests and timeshare estates, vacation exchange rights,
vacation conveniences and services, club memberships, and any other intangible
rights and benefits available to a timeshare unit owner.  Nothing in this
section shall be construed as requiring the assessment of any real property
interest associated with a timeshare interest or timeshare estate at less than
its fair market value.  Notice of assessment, delinquency, sale, or any other
purpose required by law is considered sufficient for all purposes if the
notice is given to the management committee.
