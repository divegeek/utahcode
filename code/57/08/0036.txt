57-8-36.   Existing projects -- Effect of statutory amendments.
Any condominium project established by instruments filed for record prior to
the effective date of the foregoing amendments to the Condominium Ownership
Act (hereinafter referred to as an "existing project") and the rights and
obligations of all parties interested in any such existing project shall, to
the extent that the declaration, bylaws, and condominium plat concerning the
existing project are inconsistent with the provisions of these amendments, be
governed and controlled by the provisions of the Condominium Ownership Act as
they existed prior to these amendments and by the terms of the existing
project's declaration, bylaws, and condominium plat to the extent that these
terms are consistent with applicable law other than these amendments.  Any
existing project containing or purporting to contain time period units,
convertible land, or convertible space, any existing project which is or
purports to be a contractible, expandable, or leasehold condominium, the
validity of any such project, and the validity and enforceability of any
provisions concerning time period units, convertible land, convertible space,
withdrawable land, additional land, or leased land which are set forth in an
existing project's declaration, bylaws, or condominium plat, shall be governed
by applicable law in effect prior to these amendments, including principles
relating to reasonableness, certainty, and constructive and actual notice,
shall not necessarily be ineffective or defeated in whole or in part because
the project or provision in question does not comply or substantially comply
with those requirements of the foregoing amendments which would have been
applicable had the instruments creating the project been recorded after the
effective date of these amendments, but shall, in any event, be valid,
effective, and enforceable if the project or provision in question either
substantially complies with those requirements of the foregoing amendments
which relate to the subject at issue or employs an arrangement which
substantially achieves the same policy as underlies those requirements of the
foregoing amendments which relate to the subject at issue.
