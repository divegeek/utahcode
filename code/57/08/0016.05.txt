(b)  after units to which three-fourths of the undivided interest in the common areas and facilities appertain have been conveyed, or after all additional land has been added to the project and all convertible land has been converted, whichever last occurs.

(2)  If entered into during the period of control contemplated by Subsection (1), no management contract, lease of recreational areas or facilities, or any other contract or lease designed to benefit the declarant which was executed by or on behalf of the unit owners' association or the unit owners as a group shall be binding after such period of control unless then renewed or ratified by the consent of unit owners of units to which a majority of the votes in the unit owners' association appertains.

(3)  If the unit owners' association or management committee is not in existence or does not have officers at the time of the creation of a condominium project, the declarant shall, until there is an association or management committee with these officers, have the power and responsibility to act in all instances where this act or the declaration requires action by the unit owners' association, the management committee, or any of the officers of them.

(4)  This section shall be strictly construed to protect the rights of the unit owners.
