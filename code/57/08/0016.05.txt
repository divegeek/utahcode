57-8-16.5.   Appointment and removal of committee members and association
officers -- Renewal or ratification of contracts -- Failure to establish
association or committee.
(1)  The declaration may authorize the declarant, or a managing agent or some
other person or persons selected or to be selected by the declarant, to
appoint and remove some or all of the members of the management committee or
some or all of the officers of the unit owners' association, or to exercise
powers and responsibilities otherwise assigned by the declaration and by this
act to the unit owners' association, its officers, or the management
committee. No amendment to the declaration not consented to by all unit owners
shall increase the scope of this authorization, and no such authorization
shall be valid after the first to occur of the following:
(a)  expiration of the time limit set by the declaration, which shall not
exceed six years in the case of an expandable condominium, four years in the
case of a condominium project containing any convertible land, or three years
in the case of any other condominium project; or
(b)  after units to which three-fourths of the undivided interest in the
common areas and facilities appertain have been conveyed, or after all
additional land has been added to the project and all convertible land has
been converted, whichever last occurs.
(2)  If entered into during the period of control contemplated by Subsection
(1), no management contract, lease of recreational areas or facilities, or any
other contract or lease designed to benefit the declarant which was executed
by or on behalf of the unit owners' association or the unit owners as a group
shall be binding after such period of control unless then renewed or ratified
by the consent of unit owners of units to which a majority of the votes in the
unit owners' association appertains.
(3)  If the unit owners' association or management committee is not in
existence or does not have officers at the time of the creation of a
condominium project, the declarant shall, until there is an association or
management committee with these officers, have the power and responsibility to
act in all instances where this act or the declaration requires action by the
unit owners' association, the management committee, or any of the officers of
them.
(4)  This section shall be strictly construed to protect the rights of the
unit owners.
