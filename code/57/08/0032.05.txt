57-8-32.5.   Property taken by eminent domain -- Allocation of award --
Reallocation of interests.
(1)  If any portion of the common areas and facilities is taken by eminent
domain, the award for it shall be allocated to the unit owners in proportion
to their respective undivided interests in the common areas and facilities.
(2)  If any units are taken by eminent domain, the undivided interest in the
common areas and facilities appertaining to these units shall thenceforth
appertain to the remaining units, being allocated to them in proportion to
their respective undivided interests in the common areas and facilities. The
court shall enter a decree reflecting the reallocation of undivided interests
so produced, and the award shall include, without limitation, just
compensation to the unit owner of any unit taken for his undivided interest in
the common areas and facilities as well as for his unit.
(3)  If portions of any unit are taken by eminent domain, the court shall
determine the fair market value of the portions of the unit not taken, and the
undivided interest in the common areas and facilities appertaining to any such
units shall be reduced, in the case of each unit, in proportion to the
diminution in the fair market value of the unit resulting from the taking. The
portions of undivided interest in the common areas and facilities thus
divested from the unit owners of these units shall be reallocated among these
units and the other units in the condominium project in proportion to their
respective undivided interests in the common areas and facilities, with any
units partially taken participating in the reallocation on the basis of their
undivided interests as reduced in accordance with the preceding sentence. The
court shall enter a decree reflecting the reallocation of undivided interests
produced by this, and the award shall include, without limitation, just
compensation to the unit owner of any unit partially taken for that portion of
his undivided interest in the common areas and facilities divested from him by
operation of the first sentence of this Subsection (3), and not revested in
him by operation of the following sentence, as well as for that portion of his
unit taken by eminent domain.
(4)  The court shall enter a decree reflecting the reallocation of undivided
interests produced by this, and the award shall include, without limitation,
just compensation to the unit owner of any unit partially taken for that
portion of his undivided interest in the common areas and facilities divested
from him and also not revested in him under this Subsection (4), as well as
for that portion of his unit taken by eminent domain.
(5)  If, however, the taking of a portion of any unit makes it impractical to
use the remaining portion of that unit for any lawful purpose permitted by the
declaration, then the entire undivided interest in the common areas and
facilities appertaining to that unit shall thenceforth appertain to the
remaining units, being allocated to them in proportion to their respective
undivided interest in the common areas and facilities, and the remaining
portion of that unit shall thenceforth be a common area and facility. The
court shall enter a decree reflecting the reallocation of undivided interests
produced by this, and the award shall include, without limitation, just
compensation to the unit owner of the unit for his entire undivided interest
in the common areas and facilities and for his entire unit.
