57-8-13.10.   Condominiums containing convertible land -- Expandable condominiums -- Allocation of interests in common areas and facilities.

(1)  If a condominium project contains any convertible land or is an expandable condominium, then the declaration may not allocate undivided interests in the common areas and facilities on the basis of par value unless the declaration:

(a)  prohibits the creation of any units not substantially identical to the units depicted on the condominium plat recorded pursuant to Subsection 57-8-13(1); or

(b)  prohibits the creation of any units not described under Subsection 57-8-10(3)(a)(vii) in the case of convertible land, Subsection 57-8-10(4)(a)(xi) in the case of additional land, and contains from the outset a statement of the par value that shall be assigned to every unit that may be created.

(2) (a)  Interests in the common areas and facilities  may not be allocated to any units to be created within any convertible land or within any additional land until a condominium plat depicting the same is recorded pursuant to Subsection 57-8-13(2).

(b)  Simultaneously with the recording of the supplemental condominium plat required under Subsection (2)(a), the declarant shall execute and record an amendment to the declaration which reallocates undivided interests in the common areas and facilities so that the units depicted on the supplemental condominium plat shall be allocated undivided interests in the common areas and facilities on the same basis as the units depicted on the condominium plat that was recorded simultaneously with the declaration pursuant to Subsection 57-8-13(1).

(3)  If all of a convertible space is converted into common areas and facilities, including limited common areas and facilities, then the undivided interest in the common areas and facilities appertaining to the convertible space shall afterward appertain to the remaining units and shall be allocated among them in proportion to their undivided interests in the common areas and facilities.  The principal officer of the unit owners' association or of the management committee, or any other officer specified in the declaration, shall immediately prepare, execute, and record an amendment to the declaration reflecting the reallocation of undivided interest produced by the conversion.

(4) (a)  If the expiration or termination of any lease of a leasehold condominium causes a contraction of the condominium project which reduces the number of units, or if the withdrawal of withdrawable land of a contractible condominium causes a contraction of the condominium project which reduces the number of units, the undivided interest in the common areas and facilities appertaining to any units so withdrawn shall afterward appertain to the remaining units, being allocated among them in proportion to their undivided interests in the common areas and facilities.

(b)  The principal officer of the unit owners' association or of the management committee, or any other officer specified in the declaration shall immediately prepare, execute, and record an amendment to the declaration, reflecting the reallocation of undivided interests produced by the reduction of units.
