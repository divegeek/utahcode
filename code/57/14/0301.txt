(C)  a child is likely to trespass at the location of the artificial condition;

(b) (i)  the serious physical injury or death:

(b)  An owner is not subject to liability for serious physical injury or death to a trespasser under Subsection (2) if the burden on the owner to eliminate, or to protect against serious physical injury or death from, the artificial condition outweighs the risk of serious physical injury or death posed by the artificial condition.
