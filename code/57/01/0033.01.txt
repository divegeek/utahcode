57-1-33.1.   Reconveyance of a trust deed -- Erroneous reconveyance.
(1) (a)  When an obligation secured by a trust deed has been satisfied, the
trustee shall, upon written request by the beneficiary, reconvey the trust
property.
(b)  At the time the beneficiary requests a reconveyance under Subsection
(1)(a), the beneficiary shall deliver to the trustee or the trustee's
successor in interest the trust deed and the note or other evidence that the
obligation securing the trust deed has been satisfied.
(2)  The reconveyance under Subsection (1) may designate the grantee as "the
person or persons entitled thereto."
(3)  If a reconveyance is erroneously recorded by a beneficiary, the effect of
the reconveyance may be nullified and the trust deed reinstated by the
recording of a corrective affidavit executed by the then current beneficiary
describing the trust deed and setting forth the fact of the erroneous
reconveyance.  Upon the recording of a corrective affidavit or similar
instrument, the trust deed has the same priority as it did prior to the
erroneous reconveyance.  However, any lien or interest that was recorded or
attached to the trust deed property between the time of the recording of the
erroneous reconveyance and the recording of the corrective affidavit or
similar instrument has priority over the reinstated trust deed, unless the
lien or interest was recorded or attached with actual knowledge that the trust
deed had been reconveyed erroneously.
