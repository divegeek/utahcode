"Notice to Tenant

As stated in the accompanying Notice of Trustee's Sale, this property is scheduled to be sold at public auction to the highest bidder unless the default in the obligation secured by this property is cured.  If the property is sold, you may be allowed under federal law to continue to occupy your rental unit until your rental agreement expires, or until 90 days after the date you are served with a notice to vacate, whichever is later.  If your rental or lease agreement expires after the 90-day period, you may need to provide a copy of your rental or lease agreement to the new owner to prove your right to remain on the property longer than 90 days after the sale of the property.

You must continue to pay your rent and comply with other requirements of your rental or lease agreement or you will be subject to eviction for violating your rental or lease agreement.

The new owner or the new owner's representative will probably contact you after the property is sold with directions about where to pay rent.

The new owner of the property may or may not want to offer to enter into a new rental or lease agreement with you at the expiration of the period described above."
