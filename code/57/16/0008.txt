57-16-8.   Payment of rent and fees during pendency of eviction proceeding.
If a resident elects to contest an eviction proceeding, all rents, fees, and
service charges due and incurred during the pendency of the action shall be
paid into court according to the current mobile home park payment schedule.
Failure of the resident to pay such amounts may, in the discretion of the
court, constitute grounds for granting summary judgment in favor of the mobile
home park.  Upon final termination of the issues between the parties, the
court shall order all amounts paid into court paid to the mobile home park.
The prevailing party is also entitled to court costs and reasonable attorney's
fees.
