57-10-4.   Legal effect of descriptions using coordinate values.
(1)  A description of the location of any survey station or land boundary
corner in the state is complete, legal, and satisfactory if it is expressed by
use of the system of plane coordinates defined in this chapter.
(2)  For purposes of sale or title transfer, no real property may be described
solely by reference to coordinate values from the Utah coordinate system or
any other coordinate system.
(3)  When coordinates based on the Utah coordinate system are used in the
description of any tract of land, they are supplemental to the basic
description relating to existing recognized monuments and land lines of
record.
(4)  The description by reference to the subdivision, line, or corner of the
United States public land surveys prevails over the description by
coordinates, if there is any conflict between the descriptions.
