57-6-3.   Rights of parties -- Acquiring other's interest or holding as
tenants in common.
The plaintiff in the main action may thereupon pay the appraised value of the
improvements and take the property, but should he fail to do so after a
reasonable time, to be fixed by the court, the defendant may take the property
upon paying its value, exclusive of the improvements. If this is not done
within a reasonable time, to be fixed by the court, the parties will be held
to be tenants in common of all the real estate, including the improvements,
each holding an interest proportionate to the values ascertained on the trial.
