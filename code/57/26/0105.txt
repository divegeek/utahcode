57-26-105.   Recordation -- Perfection of security interest in rents --
Priority of conflicting interests in rents.
(1)  A document creating an assignment of rents may be submitted for recording
in the office of the county recorder for the county in which the property is
situated in the same manner as any other document evidencing a conveyance of
an interest in real property.
(2)  Upon recording, the security interest in rents created by an assignment
of rents is fully perfected, even if a provision of the document creating the
assignment or law of this state other than this chapter would preclude or
defer enforcement of the security interest until the occurrence of a
subsequent event, including a subsequent default of the assignor, the
assignee's obtaining possession of the real property, or the appointment of a
receiver.
(3)  Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (4), a perfected security
interest in rents takes priority over the rights of a person that, after the
security interest is perfected:
(a)  acquires a judicial lien against the rents or the real property from
which the rents arise; or
(b)  purchases an interest in the rents or the real property from which the
rents arise.
(4)  A perfected security interest in rents has priority over the rights of a
person described in Subsection (3) with respect to future advances to the same
extent as the assignee's security interest in the real property has priority
over the rights of that person with respect to future advances.
