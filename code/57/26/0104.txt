57-26-104.   Security instrument creates assignment of rents -- Assignment of rents creates security interest.

(1)  An enforceable security instrument creates an assignment of rents arising from the real property described in the security instrument, unless the security instrument provides otherwise.

(2)  An assignment of rents creates a presently effective security interest in all accrued and unaccrued rents arising from the real property described in the document creating the assignment, regardless of whether the document is in the form of an absolute assignment, an absolute assignment conditioned upon default, an assignment as additional security, or any other form.  The security interest in rents is separate and distinct from any security interest held by the assignee in the real property.
