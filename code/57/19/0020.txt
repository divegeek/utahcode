57-19-20.   Injunctive relief -- Cease and desist order.

(1)  Whenever it appears to the director that any person has engaged or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any provision of this chapter, and that it would be in the public interest to stop those acts or practices, the director may either:

(a)  seek injunctive relief as provided in Rule 65A, Utah Rules of Civil Procedure; or

(b)  issue an administrative cease and desist order.

(2)  If an administrative cease and desist order is issued pursuant to Subsection (1), the person upon whom the order is served may, within 10 days after receiving the order, request that a hearing be held before an administrative law judge.  If a request for a hearing is made, the division shall follow the procedures and requirements of Title 63G, Chapter 4, Administrative Procedures Act.  Pending the hearing, the order remains in effect.

(3)  If, at the hearing, a finding is made that there has been a violation of this chapter, the director, with the concurrence of the executive director, may issue an order making the cease and desist order permanent.  If no hearing is requested, and if the person fails to cease the act or practice, or after discontinuing the act or practice again commences it, the director shall file suit in the district court of the county in which the act or practice occurred, or where the person resides or carries on business, to enjoin and restrain the person from violating this chapter.

(4)  Whether or not the director has issued a cease and desist order, the attorney general, in the name of the state or of the director, may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin any act or practice constituting a violation of any provision of this chapter, and to enforce compliance with this chapter or any rule or order under this chapter.  Upon a proper showing, a permanent or temporary injunction, restraining order, or writ of mandamus shall be granted.
