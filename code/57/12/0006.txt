57-12-6.   Buildings, structures or other improvements.

(1) Where any interest in real property is acquired, an equal interest in all buildings, structures, or other improvements located upon the real property so acquired and which is required to be removed from the real property or which is determined to be adversely affected by the use to which the real property will be put, shall be acquired.

(2)  For the purpose of determining the just compensation to be paid for any building, structure, or other improvement required to be acquired under Subsection (1), the building, structure, or other improvement shall be deemed to be a part of the real property to be acquired, notwithstanding the right or obligation of a tenant, as against the owner of any other interest in the real property, to remove the building, structure, or improvement at the expiration of his term; and the fair market value which the building, structure, or improvement contributes to the fair market value of the property to be acquired, or the fair market value of the building, structure, or improvement for removal from the real property, whichever is the greater, shall be paid to the tenant therefor.

(3)  Payment for the buildings, structures, or improvements as set forth in Subsection (2) shall not result in duplication of any payments otherwise authorized by state law. No payment shall be made unless the owner of the land involved disclaims all interest in the improvements of the tenant. In consideration for any payment, the tenant shall assign, transfer, and release all his right, title and interest in and to the improvements. Nothing with regard to this acquisition of buildings, structures, or other improvements shall be construed to deprive the tenants of any rights to reject payment and to obtain payment for these property interests in accordance with other laws of this state.
