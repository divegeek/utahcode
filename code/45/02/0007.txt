45-2-7.   Limitations and restrictions -- Immune from liability -- Due care.
Except as provided in Section 45-2-1.5, nothing in this act contained shall be
construed to relieve any person broadcasting over a radio or television
station from liability under the law of libel, slander, or defamation. Nor
shall anything else in this act be construed to relieve any person, firm, or
corporation owning or operating a radio or television broadcasting station or
network from liability under the law of libel, slander, or defamation on
account of any broadcast prepared or made by any such person, firm, or
corporation or by any officer or employee thereof in the course of his
employment. In no event, however, shall any such person, firm, or corporation
be liable for any damages for any defamatory statement or act published or
uttered in or as a part of a visual or sound broadcast unless it shall be
alleged and proved by the complaining party that such person, firm, or
corporation has failed to exercise due care to prevent the publication or
utterance of such statement or act in such broadcast. Bona fide compliance
with any federal law or the regulation of any federal regulatory agency shall
be deemed to constitute such due care as hereinabove mentioned.
