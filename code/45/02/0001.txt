If it shall appear on the trial of any action brought for the publication of
any alleged libel in any newspaper published in this state that the alleged
libel was published in good faith, that the publication thereof was due to
mistake or misapprehension of the facts, and that a full and fair retraction
of any statement therein alleged to be erroneous was published in the same
type and in the same position on the same page as was the article complained
of as libelous, in the next regular issue of such newspaper, or in case of a
daily paper within three days, after service upon the publisher of such
newspaper, at the principal office of its publication by the party aggrieved,
of a written notice specifying the statement alleged to be erroneous, or, in
case such notice is not served in the issue or within the time above specified
after the filing of the complaint and service of the summons in said action,
then the plaintiff shall recover only actual damages; provided, that if such
libel was published in a Sunday edition, the publication of the retraction
must have been in a Sunday edition within two weeks after the times above
specified; provided further, that this section shall not apply in the case of
any libel against any candidate for a public office at any election or
primary, or any avowed candidate for nomination to any office before any
political convention, unless the retraction of the charge was made editorially
in a conspicuous manner at least five days before the holding of such
election, primary or political convention in case such libelous article was
published in a daily paper, or if published in a weekly paper, at least three
days before the holding thereof, which editorial retraction shall be in lieu
of any other retraction herein provided for.
