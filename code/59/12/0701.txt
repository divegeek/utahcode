59-12-701.   Purpose statement.
The Utah Legislature finds and declares that:
(1)  Recreational and zoological facilities and the botanical, cultural, and
zoological organizations of the state of Utah enhance the quality of life of
Utah's citizens, as well as the continuing growth of Utah's tourist,
convention, and recreational industries.
(2)  Utah was the first state in this nation to create and financially support
a state arts agency, now the Utah Arts Council, which is committed to the
nurturing and growth of cultural pursuits.
(3)  Utah has provided, and intends to continue, the financial support of
recreational and zoological facilities and the botanical, cultural, and
zoological organizations of this state.
(4)  The state's support of its recreational and zoological facilities and its
botanical, cultural, and zoological organizations has not been sufficient to
assure the continuing existence and growth of these facilities and
organizations, and the Legislature believes that local government may wish to
play a greater role in the support of these organizations.
(5)  Without jeopardizing the state's ongoing support of its recreational and
zoological facilities and its botanical, cultural, and zoological
organizations, the Legislature intends to permit the counties of the state of
Utah to enhance public financial support of Utah's publicly owned or operated
recreational and zoological facilities, and botanical, cultural, and
zoological organizations owned or operated by institutions or private
nonprofit organizations, through the imposition of a county sales and use tax.
(6)  In a county of the first class, it is necessary and appropriate to
allocate a tax imposed under this part in a manner that provides adequate
predictable support to a fixed number of botanical and cultural organizations
and that gives the county legislative body discretion to allocate the tax
revenues to other botanical and cultural organizations.
