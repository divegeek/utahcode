(c)  passenger ropeways as defined in Section 72-11-102.

(2)  The investment incentive allowed in Subsection (1) shall be paid from the Ski Resort Capital Investment Restricted Account created in Subsection (5).  The investment incentive shall be allowed only to the extent that for each dollar of investment incentive allowed, three dollars shall be expended for the purchase or lease of property described in Subsection (1) by a person operating a ski resort.
