59-12-202.   Purpose and intent.
(1)  It is the purpose of this part to provide the counties, cities, and towns
of the state with an added source of revenue and to thereby assist them to
meet their growing financial needs.  It is the legislative intent that this
added revenue be used to the greatest possible extent by the counties, cities,
and towns to finance their capital outlay requirements and to service their
bonded indebtedness.
(2)  It is the purpose of this part to provide an orderly and efficient system
of administering, operating, and enforcing the state and local option sales
and use tax.  The Legislature finds that intervention by counties, cities, and
towns into the administration, operation, and enforcement of the local sales
and use tax, particularly in the hearing and appeal process, increases the
cost of administering both the local option sales and use tax and the state
sales and use tax proceedings, and substantially delays the receipt of
revenues for counties, cities, towns, and the state.  The Legislature finds
that the interests and concerns of counties, cities, and towns can be
adequately protected through the commission's enforcement efforts.  It is
therefore the Legislature's intent to grant the commission exclusive authority
to administer, operate, and enforce the local option sales and use tax,
without interference from counties, cities, and towns and to allow
intervention by any county, city, or town only in the limited circumstances
where a particular hearing or appeal may result in a significant lessening of
the revenues of any single county, city, or town.
