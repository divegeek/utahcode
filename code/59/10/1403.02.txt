an amount:
(i)  determined by the commission by rule made in accordance with Title 63G,

liability of the pass-through entity taxpayer under this chapter with respect

(B)  notwithstanding Subsection (2)(b)(ii)(D), take into account the
refundable tax credit provided in Section 59-6-102; and

(B)  a passive loss;
(C)  another item of deduction or loss if that item of deduction or loss is

(II)  this chapter.
(c)  The rules the commission makes in accordance with Subsection (2)(a) may
establish a method for taking into account items of income, gain, loss,
deduction, or credit of a pass-through entity if:
(i)  for a pass-through entity except for a pass-through entity that is an S
corporation, the pass-through entity does not analyze the items of income,
gain, loss, deduction, or credit on the schedule for reporting partners'
distributive share items as part of the federal income tax return for the
pass-through entity; or
(ii)  for a pass-through entity that is an S corporation, the pass-through

through entity taxpayer.
