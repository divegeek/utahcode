(a)  No joint return shall be made if the husband and wife are not permitted to file a joint return for federal income tax purposes.

(b)  If the federal income tax liability of husband or wife is determined on a separate return for federal income tax purposes, the income tax liability of each spouse shall be determined on a separate return under this chapter.
