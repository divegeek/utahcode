(a)  bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness issued by the state and its agencies and instrumentalities, and bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness of any political subdivision as described in Section 11-14-303; and

(b)  stocks, notes, or obligations issued by, or guaranteed by the United States Government, or any of its agencies and instrumentalities as defined under federal law.
