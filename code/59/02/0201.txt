(vi)  all machinery used in mining, all property or surface improvements upon or appurtenant to mines or mining claims.  For the purposes of assessment and taxation, all processing plants, mills, reduction works, and smelters which are primarily used by the owner of a mine or mining claim for processing, reducing, or smelting minerals taken from a mine or mining claim shall be considered appurtenant to that mine or mining claim, regardless of actual location.

(B)  owned by a person other than the air charter service.

(ii)  For purposes of this Subsection (1)(b):

(A)  "person" means a natural person, individual, corporation, organization, or other legal entity; and

(B)  a person does not qualify as a person other than the air charter service as described in Subsection (1)(b)(i)(B) if the person is:

(I)  a principal, owner, or member of the air charter service; or

(II)  a legal entity that has a principal, owner, or member of the air charter service as a principal, owner, or member of the legal entity.

(c)  Real property, improvements, equipment, fixtures, or other personal property in this state owned by the company shall be assessed separately by the local county assessor.

(3)  The method for determining the fair market value of productive mining property is the capitalized net revenue method or any other valuation method the commission believes, or the taxpayer demonstrates to the commission's satisfaction, to be reasonably determinative of the fair market value of the mining property.  The rate of capitalization applicable to mines shall be determined by the commission, consistent with a fair rate of return expected by an investor in light of that industry's current market, financial, and economic conditions.  In no event may the fair market value of the mining property be less than the fair market value of the land, improvements, and tangible personal property upon or appurtenant to the mining property.
