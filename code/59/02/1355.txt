59-2-1355.   Trial -- Findings -- Decree.
The action shall be tried and determined as actions to foreclose mortgage
liens, and the court shall determine and adjudge the amount of taxes,
interest, penalties, and costs on each parcel of property which has been
separately assessed, and shall enter its decree determining the rights, and
priorities of liens, of all parties to the action.  The court shall also in
its decree direct the sheriff to advertise and sell, as in the case of sales
on execution, each parcel of property, or so much as may be necessary for the
payment of the total amount of the general taxes due, with interest,
penalties, and costs, unless the amount is paid within a time named in the
decree, but not to exceed 30 days from the entry of the decree.  The decree
shall provide that any of the parties to the action may become purchasers at
any sale, that if less than an entire parcel of property is sold, it shall be
sold at foreclosure sale in such a manner as not to convey to the purchaser a
strip of property around the entire perimeter of the parcel, or a strip of the
parcel which, if conveyed, would prevent access to the remainder of the parcel
by the redemptive owner or otherwise unreasonably diminish the value of that
remainder, as determined by the county executive.  The decree shall also
provide that if all delinquent taxes, together with interest, levied on the
parcel of property, and all penalties and costs, are paid within the time
fixed in the decree for payment, then no sale may be made.  After the time for
redemption has expired, if no redemption has been made, the sheriff shall
execute and deliver to the purchaser a deed conveying to the purchaser all the
right, title, and interest of each and all the parties, but subject to the
lien of any general or special taxes which may have been levied on the
property conveyed, other than those for the payment of which the sale has been
made.
