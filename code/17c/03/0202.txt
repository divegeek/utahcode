(2) (a)  Except as provided in Subsection (2)(b), each economic development project area budget adopted on or after May 1, 2000 but before March 30, 2009 that provides for more than $100,000 of annual tax increment to be paid to the agency shall allocate at least 20% of the tax increment for housing as provided in Section 17C-1-412.

(b)  The 20% requirement of Subsection (2)(a) may be waived:
