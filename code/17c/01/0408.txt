(b)  If there is a qualifying decrease in the minimum basic school levy under Section 59-2-902 that would result in a reduction of the amount of tax increment to be paid to an agency:

(i)  the base taxable value of taxable property within the project area shall be reduced in the year of the qualifying decrease to the extent necessary, even if below zero, to provide the agency with approximately the same amount of tax increment that would have been paid to the agency each year had the qualifying decrease not occurred; and

(ii)  the amount of tax increment paid to the agency each year for the payment of bonds and indebtedness may not be less than what would have been paid to the agency if there had been no qualifying decrease.

(2) (a)  The amount of the base taxable value to be used in determining tax increment shall be:

(E)  an increase or decrease in the percentage of fair market value, as defined under Section 59-2-102; and

(ii)  reduced for any year to the extent necessary, even if below zero, to provide an agency with approximately the same amount of money the agency would have received without a reduction in the county's certified tax rate if:

(A)  in that year there is a decrease in the county's certified tax rate under Subsection 59-2-924.2(2) or (3)(a);

(B)  the amount of the decrease is more than 20% of the county's certified tax rate of the previous year; and

(C)  the decrease would result in a reduction of the amount of tax increment to be paid to the agency.

(b)  Notwithstanding an increase or decrease under Subsection (2)(a), the amount of tax increment paid to an agency each year for payment of bonds or other indebtedness may not be less than would have been paid to the agency each year if there had been no increase or decrease under Subsection (2)(a).
