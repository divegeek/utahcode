first generated in its final form as an electronic record or otherwise; and

person if the requirements of Subsection (1) are satisfied.
(4)  If a law requires a record to be presented or retained in its original
form, or provides consequences if the record is not presented or retained in
its original form, that law is satisfied by an electronic record retained in
accordance with Subsection (1).

retention of an electronic record of the information on the front and back of
the check in accordance with Subsection (1).
(6)  A record retained as an electronic record in accordance with Subsection

prohibits the use of an electronic record for the specified purpose.

additional requirements for the retention of a record subject to the agency's
