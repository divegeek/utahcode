(2)  If substantial excess reserves are accrued above those required by this chapter, and the board determines that a refund is appropriate, a refund shall be made:

(a)  to covered employers which shall then make a refund to covered individuals on the basis of the contribution of each to the plan; or

(b)  directly to covered individuals on the basis of the contribution of each to the plan.
