(2) (a)  The board shall act as trustees of the Utah State Retirement Investment Fund and, through the executive director, may commingle and pool the funds and investments of any system, plan, or program into the Utah State Retirement Investment Fund, if the principal amounts of the participating funds do not lose their individual identity and are maintained as separate trust funds on the books of the office.
