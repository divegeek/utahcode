(1)  School officials may:

to the extent allowed by law when federal funds for that program are
subsequently reduced or eliminated.
(2)  School officials shall:
(a)  prioritize resources, especially to resolve conflicts between federal
provisions or between federal and state programs, including:
(i)  providing first priority to meeting state goals, objectives, program
needs, and accountability systems as they relate to federal programs; and
(ii)  providing second priority to implementing federal goals, objectives,
program needs, and accountability systems that do not directly and
simultaneously advance state goals, objectives, program needs, and
accountability systems;
(b)  interpret the provisions of federal programs in the best interest of
students in this state;
(c)  maximize local control and flexibility;
(d)  minimize additional state resources that are diverted to implement
federal programs beyond the federal monies that are provided to fund the

are underfunded or provide conflicts with other state or federal programs,
including:
(i)  federal statutes;
(ii)  federal regulations; and
(iii)  other federal policies and interpretations of program provisions; and
(f)  seek waivers from all possible federal statutes, requirements,
regulations, and program provisions from federal education officials to:
(i)  maximize state flexibility in implementing program provisions; and
(ii)  receive reasonable time to comply with federal program provisions.
(3)  The requirements of school officials under this part, including the
responsibility to lobby federal officials, are not intended to mandate school
officials to incur costs or require the hiring of lobbyists, but are intended
to be performed in the course of school officials' normal duties.
