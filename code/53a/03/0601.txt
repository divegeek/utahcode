53A-3-601.   Legislative findings.

The Legislature recognizes broad-based support from the general public and the state's education community for school and school district performance reports.  The Legislature further recognizes that a number of school districts are already committed to a reporting program that gives parents individual student achievement test information, that provides school test data results to the school's community, and that publishes district-wide test results for distribution to the general public.
