53A-11-204.   Nursing services in the public schools -- Collaborative
efforts.
(1) (a) Students in the state's public schools may be better protected against
risks to health and safety if schools were to have registered nurses readily
available to assist in providing educational and nursing services in the
public schools.
(b)  Those services would be further enhanced if they could be offered with
the active support and participation of local public health departments and
private medical providers, most particularly in those areas of the state
without currently functioning collaborative programs.
(c) (i)  School districts, local health departments, private medical
providers, and parents of students are therefore encouraged to work together
in determining needs and risks to student health in the state’s public
schools and in developing and implementing plans to meet those needs and
minimize risks to students.
(ii)  School community councils or school directors of affected schools shall
review the plans prior to their implementation.
(2)  School districts are encouraged to provide nursing services equivalent to
the services of one registered nurse for every 5,000 students or, in districts
with fewer than 5,000 students, the level of services recommended by the
Department of Health.
