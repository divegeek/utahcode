(2) (a)  Any school district whose property has been lost or willfully cut, defaced, or otherwise injured may withhold the issuance of official written grade reports, diploma, and transcripts of the student responsible for the damage or loss until the student or the student's parent or guardian has paid for the damages.

(b)  The student's parent or guardian is liable for damages as otherwise provided in Section 78A-6-1113.

(3) (a)  If the student and the student's parent or guardian are unable to pay for the damages or if it is determined by the school in consultation with the student's parents that the student's interests would not be served if the parents were to pay for the damages, then, the school district shall provide for a program of voluntary work for the student in lieu of the payment.

(b)  The district shall release the official grades, diploma, and transcripts of the student upon completion of the voluntary work.
