(3) (a)  The individuals referred to in Subsection (1) shall determine the portion of bonded indebtedness and other indebtedness of the transferor board for which the transferred property remains subject to the levy of taxes to pay a proportionate share of the outstanding indebtedness of the transferor board.

(b)  This is done by:

(5)  If the transferee school district assumes the obligation to pay this proportionate share of the transferor school board's indebtedness, the transferee school board shall levy a tax in the whole of the transferee district, including the transferred portion, sufficient to pay the assumed indebtedness, and shall turn over the proceeds of the tax to the business administrator of the transferor board.

(6)  If the transferee school board does not assume this obligation, the transferee school board shall levy a tax on the transferred territory sufficient to pay the proportionate share of the indebtedness determined under this section, and shall turn over the proceeds of the tax to the business administrator of the transferor board.

(7)  For the purposes of school districts affected by repealed laws governing the annexation of an unincorporated area of a school district by a city which included what was formerly known as a city school district, transitions of unincorporated areas and property from the transferor district to the transferee district in progress on the effective date of this act shall revert to the boundaries and ownership prior to the initiation of annexation and may then proceed under this section and Section 53A-2-104.
