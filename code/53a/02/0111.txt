53A-2-111.   Legislative findings.

The Legislature finds that restructuring and consolidation of school districts may provide long-term educational and financial benefits, but that short-term costs and other problems may make it difficult for school officials to move forward with such plans.  The Legislature therefore adopts Sections 53A-2-111 through 53A-2-116 to assist the public school system to create more efficient and effective administrative units.
