(2) (a)  If an annexation of property by a city would result in its residents being served by more than one school district, then the presidents of the affected local school boards shall meet within 60 days prior to the effective date of the annexation to determine whether it would be advisable to adjust school district boundaries to permit all residents of the expanded city to be served by a single school district.

(ii)  The two local board-appointed members of the committee shall meet and appoint a third member of the committee.
