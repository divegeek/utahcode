(a)  enroll foreign exchange students that do not qualify for state money; and

(b)  pay for the costs of those students with other funds available to the school district or charter school.

(4)  Due to the benefits to all students of having the opportunity to become familiar with individuals from diverse backgrounds and cultures, school districts are encouraged to enroll foreign exchange students, as provided in Subsection (3), particularly in schools with declining or stable enrollments where the incremental cost of enrolling the foreign exchange student may be minimal.

(iv)  that a representative of the exchange student agency shall visit each student's place of residence at least once each month during the student's stay in Utah;
