compliance prior to the beginning of each school year.

(i)  that the agency has complied with all applicable policies of the board;
(ii)  that a household study, including a background check of all adult
residents, has been made of each household where an exchange student is to
reside, and that the study was of sufficient scope to provide reasonable
assurance that the exchange student will receive proper care and supervision
in a safe environment;

positions, including information about enhanced criminal penalties under
Subsection 76-5-406(10) for persons who are in a position of special trust;

numbers of individuals not associated with the agency who could be called by
