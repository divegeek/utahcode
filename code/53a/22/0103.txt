year comprehensive capital outlay plan, which shall be approved by the State

this chapter does not provide minimal facilities as defined by the State Board
of Education for students in any new and remote community established in the
district, or for students in existing communities because of the location of
new or expanded industries in the area, the district may enter into lease-
purchase agreements or lease with option to purchase agreements with private
