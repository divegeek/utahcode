(a)  an individual serving in the Armed Forces of the United States, the
United States Public Health Service, the United States Department of Veterans
Affairs, or other federal agencies while engaged in activities regulated under
this chapter as a part of employment with that federal agency if the person
holds a valid certificate or license to provide interpreter services issued by
any other state or jurisdiction recognized by the State Board of Education;
(b)  a student engaged in providing interpreter services while in training in

and the services are a defined part of the training program;
(c)  an individual engaged in an internship, residency, apprenticeship, or on-
the-job training program approved by the State Board of Education while under
the supervision of qualified persons;
(d)  an individual residing in another state and certified or licensed to
provide interpreter services in that state, who is called in for a
consultation by an individual certified to provide interpreter services in
this state, and the services provided are limited to that consultation;
(e)  an individual who is invited by a recognized school, association, or
other body approved by the State Board of Education to conduct a lecture,
clinic, or demonstration on interpreter services if the individual does not
establish a place of business or regularly engage in the practice of providing
interpreter services in this state; and
(f)  an individual licensed in another state or country who is in this state
temporarily to attend to the needs of an athletic team or group, except that
the individual may only attend to the needs of the team or group, including
all individuals who travel with the team or group, except as a spectator.
(2) (a)  An individual temporarily in this state who is exempted from
certification under Subsection (1) shall comply with each requirement of the
jurisdiction from which the individual derives authority to practice.
(b)  Violation of any limitation imposed by this section is grounds for
removal of exempt status, denial of certification, or another disciplinary
proceeding.
(3) (a)  Upon the declaration of a national, state, or local emergency, the
State Board of Education, in collaboration with the advisory board, may
suspend the requirements for permanent or temporary certification of persons
who are certified or licensed in another state.
(b)  Individuals exempt under Subsection (3)(a) shall be exempt from
certification for the duration of the emergency while engaged in providing
interpreter services for which they are certified or licensed in the other
state.
(4)  The State Board of Education, after consulting with the advisory board,
may adopt rules for the issuance of temporary or restricted certifications if
their issuance is necessary to or justified by:
(a)  a lack of necessary available interpretive services in any area or
community of the state, if the lack of services might be reasonably considered
to materially jeopardize compliance with state or federal law; or
(b)  a need to first observe an applicant for certification in a monitored or
supervised practice of providing interpretive services before a decision is
made by the board either to grant or deny the applicant a regular
certification.
