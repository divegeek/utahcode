53A-17a-111.   Weighted pupil units for programs for students with disabilities -- District allocation.

(1)  The number of weighted pupil units for students with disabilities shall reflect the direct cost of programs for those students conducted in accordance with rules established by the State Board of Education in accordance with Title 63G, Chapter 3, Utah Administrative Rulemaking Act.

(2)  Disability program money allocated to districts is restricted and shall be spent for the education of students with disabilities but may include expenditures for approved programs of services conducted for certified instructional personnel who have students with disabilities in their classes.

(3)  The State Board of Education shall establish and strictly interpret definitions and provide standards for determining which students have disabilities and shall assist districts in determining the services that should be provided to students with disabilities.

(4)  Each year the board shall evaluate the standards and guidelines that establish the identifying criteria for disability classifications to assure strict compliance with those standards by the districts.

(5) (a)  Money appropriated to the State Board of Education for add-on WPUs for students with disabilities enrolled in regular programs shall be allocated to school districts as provided in this Subsection (5).

(b)  Beginning on July 1, 2003, the State Board of Education shall:

(i)  use a district's average number of special education add-on weighted pupil units determined by the previous five year's average daily membership data as a foundation for the special education add-on appropriation; and

(ii)  implement a hold harmless provision for up to three years as needed to accomplish a phase-in period for school districts to accommodate the change in the special education add-on WPUs foundation formula.

(c)  A district's special education add-on WPUs for the current year may not be less than the foundation special education add-on WPUs.

(d)  Growth WPUs shall be added to the prior year special education add-on WPUs, and growth WPUs shall be determined as follows:

(i)  The special education student growth factor is calculated by comparing S-3 total special education ADM of two years previous to the current year to the S-3 total special education ADM three years previous to the current year, not to exceed the official October total district growth factor from the prior year.

(ii)  When calculating and applying the growth factor, a district's S-3 total special education ADM for a given year is limited to 12.18% of the district's S-3 total student ADM for the same year.

(iii)  Growth ADMs are calculated by applying the growth factor to the S-3 total special education ADM of two years previous to the current year.

(iv)  Growth ADMs for each district are multiplied by 1.53 weighted pupil units and added to the prior year special education add-on WPU to determine each district's total allocation.

(6)  If money appropriated under this chapter for programs for students with disabilities does not meet the costs of districts for those programs, each district shall first receive the amount generated for each student with a disability under the basic program.
