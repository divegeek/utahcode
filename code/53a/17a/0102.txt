53A-17a-102.   Purpose of chapter.

(1)  The purpose of this chapter is to provide a minimum school program for the state in accordance with the constitutional mandate.  It recognizes that all children of the state are entitled to reasonably equal educational opportunities regardless of their place of residence in the state and of the economic situation of their respective school districts or other agencies.

(2)  It further recognizes that although the establishment of an educational system is primarily a state function, school districts should be required to participate on a partnership basis in the payment of a reasonable portion of the cost of a minimum program.

(3)  It is also the purpose of this chapter to describe the manner in which the state and the school districts shall pay their respective share of the costs of a minimum program.  This chapter also recognizes that each locality should be empowered to provide educational facilities and opportunities beyond the minimum program and accordingly provide a method whereby that latitude of action is permitted and encouraged.
