(5)  A pharmacist or pharmacy intern who dispenses a prescription with an interchangeable biosimilar product under this section assumes no greater liability than would be incurred had the pharmacist or pharmacy intern dispensed the prescription with the biological product prescribed.

(6) (a)  If, in the opinion of the prescribing practitioner, it is in the best interest of the patient that an interchangeable biosimilar product not be substituted for a prescribed biological product, the practitioner may prohibit a substitution either by writing "dispense as written" or by signing in the appropriate space where two lines have been preprinted on a prescription order and captioned "dispense as written" or "substitution permitted."
