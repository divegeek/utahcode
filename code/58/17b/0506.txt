Upon investigation and hearing, the division may, in its discretion, grant or deny such petition, or it may modify its original finding to reflect any circumstances that have changed sufficiently to warrant such modifications.  The division, also at its discretion, may require such person to pass an examination or examinations for re-entry into the practice of pharmacy.
