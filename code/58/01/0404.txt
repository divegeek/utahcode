(b) (i)  A diversion agreement shall contain a full detailed statement of the requirements agreed to by the licensee and a full detailed stipulation of the facts upon which the diversion agreement is premised.

(8) (a)  Upon successful completion of a diversion agreement, the director shall dismiss each charge under the director's jurisdiction of unprofessional or unlawful conduct that was filed against the licensee.

(b)  Whether or not an adjudicative proceeding had been commenced against the licensee, the division may not thereafter subject the licensee to disciplinary action for the conduct that formed the basis of the completed diversion agreement.

(c)  Neither the execution of a diversion agreement nor the dismissal of filed charges constitute disciplinary action, and no report of either may be made to disciplinary databases.

(e)  The order of dismissal shall be filed in the adjudicative proceeding in which the misconduct was charged and may reference the diversion agreement.
