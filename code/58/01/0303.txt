58-1-303.   Temporary license.
(1) (a)  The division may issue a temporary license to a person who has met
all license requirements except the passing of an examination. In this case:
(i)  the licensee shall take the next available examination; and
(ii)  the temporary license automatically expires upon release of official
examination results if the applicant fails the examination.
(b)  The division may issue a temporary license to a person licensed in
another state or country who is in Utah temporarily to teach or assist a Utah
resident licensed to practice an occupation or profession under this title.
(c)  The division may issue a temporary license to a person licensed in
another state who met the requirements for licensure in that state, which were
equal to or greater than the requirements for licensure of this state at the
time the license was obtained in the other state, upon a finding by the
division, in collaboration with the appropriate board, that the issuance of a
temporary license is necessary to or justified by:
(i)  a local or national emergency or any governmental action causing an
unusual circumstance that might be reasonably considered to materially
jeopardize the public health, safety, or welfare if a temporary license is not
issued;
(ii)  a lack of necessary available services in any community or area of the
state from an occupation or profession licensed under this title, if the lack
of services might be reasonably considered to materially jeopardize the public
health, safety, or welfare if a temporary license is not issued; or
(iii)  a need to first observe an applicant for licensure in this state in a
monitored or supervised practice of the applicant's occupation or profession
before a decision is made by the division either to grant or deny the
applicant a regular license.
(2)  The division may not issue a temporary license to a person who qualifies
for one under Subsection (1)(a) more than three consecutive times within the
three-year period immediately following the issuance of the first temporary
license.
(3)  The division may not issue a temporary license to a person solely because
there is a competitive advantage enjoyed or a competitive disadvantage
suffered by any party caused by the absence of a licensed person, unless in
addition there is or will be a material risk presented to the public health,
safety, or welfare.
