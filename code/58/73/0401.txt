Limitation on division actions.
(1)  Grounds for the following are in accordance with Section 58-1-401:
(a)  refusing to issue a license to an applicant;
(b)  refusing to renew the license of a licensee;
(c)  revoking, suspending, restricting, or placing on probation the license of
a licensee;
(d)  issuing a public or private reprimand to a licensee; and
(e)  issuing a cease and desist order.
(2)  If a court of competent jurisdiction determines a chiropractic physician
is incompetent, mentally incompetent, incapable, or mentally ill, the director
shall suspend the license of that chiropractic physician, even if an appeal is
pending.
(3) (a)  If it appears to the board there is reasonable cause to believe a
chiropractic physician who has not been judicially determined to be
incompetent, mentally incompetent, incapable, or mentally ill is unable to
practice chiropractic with reasonable skill and safety to patients by reason
of illness, drunkenness, excessive use of drugs, narcotics, chemicals, or any
other substance, or as a result of any mental or physical condition, a
petition shall be served upon that chiropractic physician for a hearing on the
sole issue of the capacity of the chiropractic physician to conduct properly
the practice of the chiropractic physician.
(b)  Every chiropractic physician licensed by this state is considered to
have:
(i)  agreed to submit to a mental or physical examination upon receipt of a
written direction given by the division with the approval of the board; and
(ii)  waived all objections to the admissibility of the examining chiropractic
physician's or other practitioner's testimony or examination reports on the
ground they constitute a privileged communication.
(c)  Failure of a chiropractic physician to submit to an examination under
Subsection (3)(b) when directed by the division, unless the failure was due to
circumstances beyond his control, constitutes grounds for immediate suspension
of the chiropractic physician's license and an order of suspension of the
license may be entered by the division without the taking of testimony or the
presentation of evidence.
(d)  A chiropractic physician whose license is suspended under this section
shall, at reasonable intervals, be afforded the opportunity to demonstrate he
can resume the competent practice of chiropractic with reasonable skill and
safety to patients.
(e)  Neither the proceedings of the board nor the action taken by it under
this section may be used against a chiropractic physician in any other
proceedings.
(4)  The terms of revocation, suspension, or probation under this chapter may
include:
(a)  revoking the license to practice either permanently or with a stated date
before which the individual may not apply for licensure;
(b)  suspending, limiting, or restricting the license to practice chiropractic
for up to five years, including limiting the practice of the person to, or
excluding from the person's practice, one or more specific branches of
medicine, including any limitation on practice within the specified branches;
(c)  requiring the license holder to submit to care, counseling, or treatment
by physicians approved by or designated by the board, as a condition for
licensure;
(d)  requiring the license holder to participate in a program of education
prescribed by the board;
(e)  requiring the license holder to practice under the direction of a
physician designated by the board for a specified period of time; or
(f)  other appropriate terms and conditions determined by the division in
collaboration with the board to be necessary to protect the public health,
safety, or welfare.
