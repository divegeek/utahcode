(4)  A health care facility which sponsors, promotes, or organizes the uncompensated care  is not liable in a medical malpractice action for acts and omissions if:

(a)  the health care facility meets the requirements in Subsection (3)(b);

(b)  the acts and omissions of the health care facility were not grossly negligent or willful and wanton; and

(c)  the health care facility has posted, in a conspicuous place, a notice that in accordance with this section the health care facility is not liable for any civil damages for acts or omissions except for those acts or omissions that are grossly negligent or are willful and wanton.
