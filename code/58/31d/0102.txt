58-31d-102.   Advanced Practice Registered Nurse Compact.

The Advanced Practice Registered Nurse Compact is hereby enacted and entered into with all other jurisdictions that legally join in the compact, which is, in form, substantially as follows:

Advanced Practice Registered Nurse Compact

ARTICLE I

Findings and Declaration of Purpose

(1)  The party states find that:

(a)  the health and safety of the public are affected by the degree of compliance with APRN licensure/authority to practice requirements and the effectiveness of enforcement activities related to state APRN licensure/authority to practice laws;

(b)  violations of APRN licensure/authority to practice and other laws regulating the practice of nursing may result in injury or harm to the public;

(c)  the expanded mobility of APRNs and the use of advanced communication technologies as part of our nation's health care delivery system require greater coordination and cooperation among states in the areas of APRN licensure/authority to practice and regulation;

(d)  new practice modalities and technology make compliance with individual state APRN licensure/authority to practice laws difficult and complex;

(e)  the current system of duplicative APRN licensure/authority to practice for APRNs practicing in multiple states is cumbersome and redundant to both APRNs and states;

(f)  uniformity of APRN requirements throughout the states promotes public safety and public health benefits; and

(g)  access to APRN services increases the public's access to health care, particularly in rural and underserved areas.

(2)  The general purposes of this compact are to:

(a)  facilitate the states' responsibilities to protect the public's health and safety;

(b)  ensure and encourage the cooperation of party states in the areas of APRN licensure/authority to practice and regulation, including promotion of uniform licensure requirements;

(c)  facilitate the exchange of information between party states in the areas of APRN regulation, investigation, and adverse actions;

(d)  promote compliance with the laws governing APRN practice in each jurisdiction; and

(e)  invest all party states with the authority to hold an APRN accountable for meeting all state practice laws in the state in which the patient is located at the time care is rendered through the mutual recognition of party state licenses.
