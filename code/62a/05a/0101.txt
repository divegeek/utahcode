persons with disabilities:
(1)  coordinate and ensure that services and supports are provided in a cost-
effective manner.  It is the intent of the Legislature that services and
supports provided under this chapter be coordinated to meet the individual
needs of persons with disabilities; and
(2)  whenever possible, regard an individual's personal choices concerning
services and supports that are best suited to his individual needs and that
promote his independence, productivity, and integration in community life.
