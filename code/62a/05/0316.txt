Pending removal to an intermediate care facility for people with an intellectual disability, an individual taken into custody or ordered to be committed under this part may be detained in the individual's home, or in some other suitable facility.

The division shall take reasonable measures, as may be necessary, to assure proper care of an individual temporarily detained under this part.
