62A-5-318.   Involuntary treatment with medication -- Committee -- Findings.
(1)  If, after commitment, a resident elects to refuse treatment with
medication, the director, the administrator of the facility for persons with
mental retardation, or a designee, shall submit documentation regarding the
resident's proposed treatment to a committee composed of:
(a)  a licensed physician experienced in treating persons with mental
retardation and related disabilities, who is not directly involved in the
resident's treatment or diagnosis, and who is not biased toward any one
facility;
(b)  a psychologist who is a designated mental retardation professional who is
not directly involved in the resident's treatment or diagnosis; and
(c)  another designated mental retardation professional of the facility for
persons with mental retardation, or a designee.
(2)  Based upon the court's finding, under Subsection 62A-5-312(13), that the
resident lacks the ability to engage in a rational decision-making process
regarding the need for habilitation, rehabilitation, care, or treatment, as
demonstrated by evidence of inability to weigh the possible costs and benefits
of treatment, the committee may authorize involuntary treatment with
medication if it determines that:
(a)  the proposed treatment is in the medical best interest of the resident,
taking into account the possible side effects as well as the potential
benefits of the medication; and
(b)  the proposed treatment is in accordance with prevailing standards of
accepted medical practice.
(3)  In making the determination described in Subsection (2), the committee
shall consider the resident's general history and present condition, the
specific need for medication and its possible side effects, and any previous
reaction to the same or comparable medication.
(4)  Any authorization of involuntary treatment under this section shall be
periodically reviewed in accordance with rules promulgated by the division.
