(1) (a)  At any time after the date income withholding begins, a party to the child support order may request a court to determine whether income withholding should be terminated due to:

(i)  good cause under Section 62A-11-502; or

(ii)  the completion of an obligor's support obligation.

(b)  An obligor's payment of overdue child support may not be the sole basis for termination of income withholding.

(b)  The obligee shall give written notice of termination to each payor:

(i)  when the obligor no longer owes child support to the obligee; or

(ii)  if the obligee and obligor enter into a written agreement that provides an alternative arrangement, which may be filed with the court.

(3)  A notice to withhold income is binding on a payor until the court or the obligee notifies the payor that his obligation to withhold income has been terminated.
