(3)  As of July 1, 1998, the attorney general's office shall represent the division with regard to actions involving minors who have not been adjudicated as abused or neglected, but who are otherwise committed to the custody of the division by the juvenile court, and who are classified in the division's management information system as having been placed in custody primarily on the basis of delinquent behavior or a status offense.  Nothing in this section may be construed to affect the responsibility of the county attorney or district attorney to represent the state in those matters, in accordance with Section 78A-6-115.
