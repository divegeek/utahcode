(2)  A county attorney or the attorney general shall institute legal action as necessary to enforce the provisions of Section  62A-4a-602 when informed of any alleged violation.

(b)  If two or more governmental entities are involved in the prosecution, the penalty amounts recovered shall be apportioned by the court among the entities, according to their involvement.

(5)  A judgment ordering the payment of any penalty or forfeiture under Subsection (3) constitutes a lien when recorded in the judgment docket, and has the same effect and is subject to the same rules as a judgment for money in a civil action.
