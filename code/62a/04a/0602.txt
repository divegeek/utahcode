However, no payment, charge, fee, reimbursement of expense, or exchange of value of any kind, or promise or agreement to make the same, may be made for that assistance.

(b)  An attorney, physician, or other person may not:

(i)  issue or cause to be issued to any person a card, sign, or device indicating that he is available to provide that assistance;

(5) (a)  Beginning May 1, 2000, neither a licensed child placing agency nor any attorney practicing in this state may place a child for adoption, either temporarily or permanently, with any individual or individuals that would not be qualified for adoptive placement pursuant to the provisions of Sections 78B-6-117, 78B-6-102, and 78B-6-137.
