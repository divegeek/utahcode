(3) (a)  If possible, consistent with the child's safety and welfare, before taking a child into protective custody, the child welfare worker shall also determine whether there are services available that, if provided to a parent or guardian of the child, would eliminate the need to remove the child from the custody of the child's parent or guardian.

(b)  If the services described in Subsection (3)(a) are reasonably available, they shall be utilized.

(c)  In determining whether the services described in Subsection (3)(a) are reasonably available, and in making reasonable efforts to provide those services, the child's health, safety, and welfare shall be the child welfare worker's paramount concern.

(ii)  an emergency placement in accordance with Section 62A-4a-209.

(c)  When making a placement under Subsection (4)(b), the Division of Child and Family Services shall give priority to a placement with a noncustodial parent, relative, or friend, in accordance with Section 62A-4a-209.

(d)  If the child is not placed with a noncustodial parent, a relative, or a designated friend, the caseworker assigned to the child shall file a report with the caseworker's supervisor explaining why a different placement was in the child's best interest.
