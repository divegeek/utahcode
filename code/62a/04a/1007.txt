(b)  the penalty for submitting false information under Section 76-8-506 and other applicable laws; and

(c)  the obligation of the division to inform law enforcement and the person alleged to have committed abuse or neglect:

(ii)  if the reporting person submits a subsequent false report involving the same alleged perpetrator or victim.

(3)  The division may inform law enforcement and the alleged perpetrator of a report for which a letter is required to be sent under Subsection (1), if an immediate referral is justified by the facts.
