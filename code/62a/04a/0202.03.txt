(b)  grounds upon which the decision to place the child into protective custody was made.

(2)  The division's investigation shall conform to reasonable professional standards, and shall include:

(i)  school personnel; and

(ii)  the child's health care provider;

(3)  The division may rely on a written report of a prior interview rather than conducting an additional interview, if:

(ii)  produced a written report;

(b)  the investigation described in Subsection (3)(a)(i) included one or more of the interviews required by Subsection (2); and

(4) (a)  The division's determination of whether a report is supported or unsupported may be based on the child's statements alone.

(b)  Inability to identify or locate the perpetrator may not be used by the division as a basis for:

(i)  determining that a report is unsupported; or

(ii)  closing the case.

(c)  The division may not determine a case to be unsupported or identify a case as unsupported solely because the perpetrator was an out-of-home perpetrator.

(d)  Decisions regarding whether a report is supported, unsupported, or without merit shall be based on the facts of the case at the time the report was made.

(5)  The division should maintain protective custody of the child if it finds that one or more of the following conditions exist:

(ii)  except as provided in Subsection (7)(c), conducted with a support person of the child's choice present.

(A)  is at least nine years old;

(B)  refuses to have the interview audio taped; and

(C)  refuses to have the interview video taped.

(ii)  If, pursuant to Subsection (7)(b)(i), an interview is conducted without being taped, the child's refusal shall be documented, as follows:

(iii)  The division shall track the number of interviews under this Subsection (7) that are not taped, and the number of refusals that are not taped, for each interviewer, in order to determine whether a particular interviewer has a higher incidence of refusals, or taped refusals, than other interviewers.

(c) (i)  Notwithstanding Subsection (7)(a)(ii), the support person who is present for an interview of a child may not be an alleged perpetrator.

(ii)  Subsection (7)(a)(ii) does not apply if the child refuses to have a support person present during the interview.
