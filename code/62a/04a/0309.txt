62A-4a-309.   Children's Account.

(1)  There is created a restricted account within the General Fund known as the "Children's Account."  The restricted account is for crediting of contributions from private sources and from appropriate revenues received under Section 26-2-12.5 for abuse and neglect prevention programs described in Section 62A-4a-305.

(2)  Money shall be appropriated from the account to the division by the Legislature under the Utah Budgetary Procedures Act, and shall be drawn upon by the director in consultation with the executive director of the department.

(3)  Except as provided in Subsection (4), the Children's Account may be used only to implement prevention programs described in Section 62A-4a-305, and may only be allocated to an entity that provides a one-to-one match, comprising a match from the community of at least 50% in cash and up to 50% in in-kind donations, which is 25% of the total funding received from the Children's Account.

(4) (a)  The entity that receives the statewide evaluation contract is excepted from the cash-match provisions of Subsection (3).

(b)  Upon recommendation of the executive director and the council, the division may reduce or waive the match requirements described in Subsection (3) for an entity, if the division determines that imposing the requirements would prohibit or limit the provision of services needed in a particular geographic area.
