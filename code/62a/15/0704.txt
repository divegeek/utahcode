affected, including antipsychotic medication, electroshock therapy, and
psychosurgery.
(2)  The requirements of this section apply to all children receiving services
or treatment from a local mental health authority, its designee, or its

Chapter 3, Utah Administrative Rulemaking Act, establishing due process

(i)  with regard to antipsychotic medications, if either the parent or child
disagrees with that treatment, a due process proceeding shall be held in
compliance with the procedures established under this Subsection (3);
(ii)  with regard to psychosurgery and electroshock therapy, a due process
proceeding shall be conducted pursuant to the procedures established under
this Subsection (3), regardless of whether the parent or child agree or

parent or child disagrees with the treatment, in which case a due process
proceeding shall be conducted pursuant to the procedures established under
this Subsection (3).
(b)  In promulgating the rules required by Subsection (3)(a), the division
shall consider the advisability of utilizing an administrative law judge,
