originating governmental entity shall promptly request that the governmental

returning the record before the completion of the audit would impair the
conduct of the audit;

requests filed within five working days of each other;

information that the requester is not entitled to inspect requires extensive
editing; or

precludes approval or denial within the time specified in Subsection (3), the
following time limits apply to the extraordinary circumstances:

(b)  If the request is forwarded promptly, the time limit for response begins
when the record is received by the office specified by rule.
