(7) (a)  All fees received under this section by a governmental entity subject to Subsection (3)(b) shall be retained by the governmental entity as a dedicated credit.

(b)  Those funds shall be used to recover the actual cost and expenses incurred by the governmental entity in providing the requested record or record series.
