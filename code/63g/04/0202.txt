(c)  in the view of the agency, the agency's administrative efficiency will be enhanced by categorizations; and

(3)  Any time before a final order is issued in any adjudicative proceeding, the presiding officer may convert a formal adjudicative proceeding to an informal adjudicative proceeding, or an informal adjudicative proceeding to a formal adjudicative proceeding if:

(b)  conversion of the proceeding does not unfairly prejudice the rights of any party.
