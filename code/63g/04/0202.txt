(1)  The agency may, by rule, designate categories of adjudicative proceedings to be conducted informally according to the procedures set forth in rules enacted under the authority of this chapter if:

(a)  the use of the informal procedures does not violate any procedural requirement imposed by a statute other than this chapter;

(b)  in the view of the agency, the rights of the parties to the proceedings will be reasonably protected by the informal procedures;

(c)  in the view of the agency, the agency's administrative efficiency will be enhanced by categorizations; and

(d)  the cost of formal adjudicative proceedings outweighs the potential benefits to the public of a formal adjudicative proceeding.

(3)  Any time before a final order is issued in any adjudicative proceeding, the presiding officer may convert a formal adjudicative proceeding to an informal adjudicative proceeding, or an informal adjudicative proceeding to a formal adjudicative proceeding if:

(a)  conversion of the proceeding is in the public interest; and

(b)  conversion of the proceeding does not unfairly prejudice the rights of any party.
