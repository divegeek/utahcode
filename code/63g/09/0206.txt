63G-9-206.   Witnesses -- Subpoena -- Examination -- Fees.
The president of the board may issue subpoenas and compel the attendance of
witnesses and the production of books and papers before the board or any
member thereof; and any member of the board may administer oaths and may
examine witnesses.  Whenever a witness is subpoenaed before the board to
testify against any claim pending before it, the board may allow a reasonable
fee to such witness for attendance, which fee must not exceed the fees allowed
by law to witnesses in civil cases, and must be paid out of the appropriation
for the contingent expenses of the board; provided, that in no instance shall
a fee be allowed to a witness who has appeared in behalf of a claimant.
