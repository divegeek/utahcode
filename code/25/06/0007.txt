25-6-7.   Transfer -- When made.
In this chapter:
(1)  A transfer is made:
(a)  with respect to an asset that is real property other than a fixture, but
including the interest of a seller or purchaser under a contract for the sale
of the asset, when the transfer is so far perfected that a good-faith
purchaser of the asset from the debtor against whom applicable law permits the
transfer to be perfected cannot acquire an interest in the asset that is
superior to the interest of the transferee; and
(b)  with respect to an asset that is not real property or that is a fixture,
when the transfer is so far perfected that a creditor on a simple contract
cannot acquire a judicial lien other than under this chapter that is superior
to the interest of the transferee.
(2)  If applicable law permits the transfer to be perfected as provided in
Subsection (1) and the transfer is not so perfected before the commencement of
an action for relief under this chapter, the transfer is deemed made
immediately before the commencement of the action.
(3)  If applicable law does not permit the transfer to be perfected as
provided in Subsection (1), the transfer is made when it becomes effective
between the debtor and the transferee.
(4)  A transfer is not made until the debtor has acquired rights in the asset
transferred.
(5)  An obligation is incurred:
(a)  if oral, when it becomes effective between the parties; or
(b)  if evidenced by a writing, when the writing executed by the obligor is
delivered to or for the benefit of the obligee.
