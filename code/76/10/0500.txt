(a)  prohibited from owning, possessing, purchasing, selling, transferring, transporting, or keeping any firearm at his place of residence, property, business, or in any vehicle lawfully in his possession or lawfully under his control; or

(b)  required to have a permit or license to purchase, own, possess, transport, or keep a firearm.

(2)  This part is uniformly applicable throughout this state and in all its political subdivisions and municipalities.   All authority to regulate  firearms shall be reserved to the state except where the Legislature specifically delegates responsibility to local authorities or state entities.  Unless specifically authorized by the Legislature by statute, a local authority or state entity may not enact or enforce any ordinance, regulation, or rule pertaining to firearms.
