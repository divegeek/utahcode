76-10-500.   Uniform law.
(1)  The individual right to keep and bear arms being a constitutionally
protected right, the Legislature finds the need to provide uniform laws
throughout the state.  Except as specifically provided by state law, a citizen
of the United States or a lawfully admitted alien shall not be:
(a)  prohibited from owning, possessing, purchasing, selling, transferring,
transporting, or keeping any firearm at his place of residence, property,
business, or in any vehicle lawfully in his possession or lawfully under his
control; or
(b)  required to have a permit or license to purchase, own, possess,
transport, or keep a firearm.
(2)  This part is uniformly applicable throughout this state and in all its
political subdivisions and municipalities.   All authority to regulate
firearms shall be reserved to the state except where the Legislature
specifically delegates responsibility to local authorities or state entities.
Unless specifically authorized by the Legislature by statute, a local
authority or state entity may not enact or enforce any ordinance, regulation,
or rule pertaining to firearms.
