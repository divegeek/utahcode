76-10-910.5.   Hold on stolen regulated metal property -- Hold notice.
(1)  If a law enforcement agency has reasonable cause to believe that items of
regulated metal in the possession of a dealer are stolen, the law enforcement
agency may issue a written hold notice.  The hold notice shall:
(a)  identify those items of regulated metal alleged to be stolen and subject
to hold; and
(b)  inform the dealer of the restrictions imposed on the regulated metal
property under Subsection (2).
(2)  For 60 days after the date of receiving a hold notice, a dealer may not
process or remove from the dealer's place of business any regulated metal
identified in the hold notice, unless the property is released earlier by the
law enforcement agency or by order of a court of competent jurisdiction.
(3)  On the expiration of the hold notice period, the hold is automatically
released, and the dealer may dispose of the regulated metal, unless otherwise
directed by a court of competent jurisdiction.
