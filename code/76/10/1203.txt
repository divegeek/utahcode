76-10-1203.   Pornographic material or performance -- Expert testimony not
required.
(1)  Any material or performance is pornographic if:
(a)  The average person, applying contemporary community standards, finds
that, taken as a whole, it appeals to prurient interest in sex;
(b)  It is patently offensive in the description or depiction of nudity,
sexual conduct, sexual excitement, sadomasochistic abuse, or excretion; and
(c)  Taken as a whole it does not have serious literary, artistic, political
or scientific value.
(2)  In prosecutions under this part, where circumstances of production,
presentation, sale, dissemination, distribution, exhibition, or publicity
indicate that the matter is being commercially exploited by the defendant for
the sake of its prurient appeal, this evidence is probative with respect to
the nature of the matter and can justify the conclusion that, in the context
in which it is used, the matter has no serious literary, artistic, political,
or scientific value.
(3)  Neither the prosecution nor the defense shall be required to introduce
expert witness testimony as to whether the material or performance is or is
not harmful to adults or minors or is or is not pornographic, or as to any
element of the definition of pornographic, including contemporary community
standards.
