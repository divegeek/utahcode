76-10-102.   Cigarettes and tobacco -- Advertising restrictions -- Warnings
in smokeless tobacco advertisements.
(1)  It is a class B misdemeanor for any person to display on any billboard,
streetcar sign, streetcar, bus, placard, or on any other object or place of
display, any advertisement of cigarettes, cigarette papers, cigars, chewing
tobacco, or smoking tobacco or any disguise or substitute of either, except
that a dealer in cigarettes, cigarette papers, tobacco or cigars, or their
substitutes, may have a sign on the front of his place of business stating
that he is a dealer in the articles; provided that nothing herein shall be
construed to prohibit the advertising of cigarettes, cigarette papers, chewing
tobacco or smoking tobacco, or any substitute of either, in any newspaper,
magazine or periodical printed or circulating in this state.
(2)  Any advertisement for smokeless tobacco placed in a newspaper, magazine,
or periodical published in this state must bear a warning which states: "Use
of smokeless tobacco may cause oral cancer and other mouth disorders and is
addictive." This warning must be in a conspicuous location and in conspicuous
and legible type, in contrast with the typography, layout, and color of all
other printed material in the advertisement.  For purposes of this subsection,
"smokeless tobacco" means any finely cut, ground, powdered, or leaf tobacco
that is intended to be placed in the oral cavity or nasal passage.  In the
event the United States Congress passes legislation which requires warnings in
advertisements of smokeless tobacco, the specific language required to be
placed in advertisements by that legislation shall take precedence over this
subsection.
