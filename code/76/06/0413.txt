76-6-413.   Release of fur-bearing animals -- Penalty -- Finding.
(1)  In any case not amounting to a felony of the second degree, any person
who intentionally and without permission of the owner releases any fur-bearing
animal raised for commercial purposes is guilty of a felony of the third
degree.
(2)  The Legislature finds that the release of fur-bearing animals raised for
commercial purposes subjects the animals to unnecessary suffering through
deprivation of food and shelter and compromises their genetic integrity,
thereby permanently depriving the owner of substantial value.
