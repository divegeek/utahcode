76-2-304.   Ignorance or mistake of fact or law.
(1) Unless otherwise provided, ignorance or mistake of fact which disproves
the culpable mental state is a defense to any prosecution for that crime.
(2)  Ignorance or mistake concerning the existence or meaning of a penal law
is no defense to a crime unless:
(a)  Due to his ignorance or mistake, the actor reasonably believed his
conduct did not constitute an offense, and
(b)  His ignorance or mistake resulted from the actor's reasonable reliance
upon:
(i)  An official statement of the law contained in a written order or grant of
permission by an administrative agency charged by law with responsibility for
interpreting the law in question; or
(ii)  A written interpretation of the law contained in an opinion of a court
of record or made by a public servant charged by law with responsibility for
interpreting the law in question.
(3)  Although an actor's ignorance or mistake of fact or law may constitute a
defense to the offense charged, he may nevertheless be convicted of a lesser
included offense of which he would be guilty if the fact or law were as he
believed.
