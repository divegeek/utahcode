(i)  the action, decision, opinion, recommendation, judgment, vote, nomination, or exercise of discretion, has occurred; or

(ii)  the public servant ceases to be a public servant.

(3)  Bribery or offering a bribe is:

(a)  a third degree felony when the value of the benefit asked for, solicited, accepted, or conferred is less than $1,000; and
