76-8-513.   False judicial or official notice.
A person is guilty of a class B misdemeanor who, with a purpose to procure the
compliance of another with a request made by the person, knowingly sends,
mails, or delivers to the person a notice or other writing which has no
judicial or other sanction but which in its format or appearance simulates a
summons, complaint, court order, or process, or an insignia, seal, or printed
form of a federal, state, or local government or an instrumentality thereof,
or is otherwise calculated to induce a belief that it does have a judicial or
other official sanction.
