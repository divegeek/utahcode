76-4-101.   Attempt -- Elements of offense.
(1)  For purposes of this part, a person is guilty of an attempt to commit a
crime if he:

the crime; and
(b) (i)  intends to commit the crime; or
(ii)  when causing a particular result is an element of the crime, he acts
with an awareness that his conduct is reasonably certain to cause that result.
(2)  For purposes of this part, conduct constitutes a substantial step if it
strongly corroborates the actor's mental state as defined in Subsection
(1)(b).
(3)  A defense to the offense of attempt does not arise:
(a)  because the offense attempted was actually committed; or
(b)  due to factual or legal impossibility if the offense could have been

to be.
