76-3-409.   Child abuse or sex offense against child -- Treatment of offender or victim -- Payment of costs.

(1)  Any person convicted in the district court of child abuse, or a sexual offense if the victim is under 18 years of age, may be ordered to participate in treatment or therapy under the supervision of the adult probation and parole section of the Department of Corrections, in cooperation with the division of children, youth, and families until the court is satisfied that such treatment or therapy has been successful or that no further benefit to the convicted offender would result if such treatment or therapy were continued.  The court may also order treatment of the victim if it believes the same would be beneficial under the circumstances.  Nothing in this section shall preclude the court from imposing any additional sentence as provided by law.

(2)  The convicted offender shall be ordered to pay, to the extent that he or she is able, the costs of his or her treatment, together with treatment costs incurred by the victim and any administrative costs incurred by the appropriate state agency in the supervision of such treatment.  If the convicted offender is unable to pay all or part of the costs of treatment, the court may order the appropriate state agency to pay such costs to the extent funding is provided by the Legislature for such purpose and shall order the convicted offender to perform public service work as compensation for the cost of treatment.
