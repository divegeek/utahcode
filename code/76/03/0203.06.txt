(2)  If the trier of fact finds beyond a reasonable doubt that a prisoner serving a sentence for a capital felony or a first degree felony commits any offense listed in Subsection (3), the court shall sentence the defendant to life in prison without parole.  However, the court may sentence the defendant to an indeterminate prison term of not less than 20 years and which may be for life if the court finds that the interests of justice would best be served and states the specific circumstances justifying the disposition on the record.

(a)  aggravated assault, Subsection 76-5-103(2);

(o)  aggravated arson, Section 76-6-103;

(p)  aggravated burglary, Section 76-6-203; and

(i)  a grievous sexual offense;

(ii)  child kidnapping, Section 76-5-301.1; or

(iii)  aggravated kidnapping, Section 76-5-302; and
