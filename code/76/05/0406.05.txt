(a)  the defendant did not use a weapon, force, violence, substantial duress or menace, or threat of harm, in committing the offense or before or after committing the offense, in an attempt to frighten the child victim or keep the child victim from reporting the offense;

(b)  the defendant did not cause bodily injury to the child victim during or as a result of the offense and did not cause the child victim severe psychological harm;

(e)  the defendant did not use, show, or display pornography or create sexually-related photographs or tape recordings in the course of the offense;

(f)  the defendant did not act in concert with another offender during the offense or knowingly commit the offense in the presence of a person other than the victim or with lewd intent to reveal the offense to another;

(g)  the defendant did not encourage, aid, allow, or benefit from any act of prostitution or sexual act by the child victim with any other person or sexual performance by the child victim before any other person;

(h)  the defendant admits the offense of which he has been convicted and has been accepted for mental health treatment in a residential sexual abuse treatment center that has been approved by the Department of Corrections under Subsection (3);

(i)  rehabilitation of the defendant through treatment is probable, based upon evidence provided by a treatment professional who has been approved by the Department of Corrections under Subsection (3) and who has accepted the defendant for treatment;

(j)  prior to being sentenced, the defendant has undergone a complete psychological evaluation conducted by a professional approved by the Department of Corrections and:

(i)  the professional's opinion is that the defendant is not an exclusive pedophile and does not present an immediate and present danger to the community if released on probation and placed in a residential sexual abuse treatment center; and

(ii)  the court accepts the opinion of the professional;

(k)  if the offense is committed by a parent, stepparent, adoptive parent, or legal guardian of the child victim, the defendant shall, in addition to establishing all other conditions of this section, establish it is in the child victim's best interest that the defendant not be imprisoned, by presenting evidence provided by a treatment professional who:

(i)  is treating the child victim and understands he will be treating the family as a whole; or

(ii)  has assessed the child victim for purposes of treatment as ordered by the court based on a showing of good cause; and

(l)  if probation is imposed, the defendant, as a condition of probation, may not reside in a home where children younger than 18 years of age reside for at least one year beginning with the commencement of treatment, and may not again take up residency in a home where children younger than 18 years of age reside during the period of probation until allowed to do so by order of the court.

(b)  The sexual abuse treatment program shall be at least one year in duration, shall be residential, and shall specifically address the sexual conduct for which the defendant was convicted.

(4)  Establishment by the defendant of all the criteria of this section does not mandate the granting under this section of probation or modification of the sentence that would otherwise be imposed by Section 76-3-406 regarding sexual offenses against children.  The court has discretion to deny the request based upon its consideration of the circumstances of the offense, including:

(a)  the nature, frequency, and duration of the conduct;

(7)  The court shall enter written findings of fact regarding the conditions established by the defendant that justify the granting of probation under this section.

(8)  In cases involving conviction of any sexual offense against a child other than those offenses provided in Subsection (1), the court shall consider the circumstances described in Subsection (1) as advisory in determining whether or not execution of sentence should be suspended and probation granted.
