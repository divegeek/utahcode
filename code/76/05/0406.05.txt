(e)  the defendant did not use, show, or display pornography or create sexually-related photographs or tape recordings in the course of the offense;

(j)  prior to being sentenced, the defendant has undergone a complete psychological evaluation conducted by a professional approved by the Department of Corrections and:

(i)  the professional's opinion is that the defendant is not an exclusive pedophile and does not present an immediate and present danger to the community if released on probation and placed in a residential sexual abuse treatment center; and

(ii)  the court accepts the opinion of the professional;

(k)  if the offense is committed by a parent, stepparent, adoptive parent, or legal guardian of the child victim, the defendant shall, in addition to establishing all other conditions of this section, establish it is in the child victim's best interest that the defendant not be imprisoned, by presenting evidence provided by a treatment professional who:

(i)  is treating the child victim and understands he will be treating the family as a whole; or

(b)  The sexual abuse treatment program shall be at least one year in duration, shall be residential, and shall specifically address the sexual conduct for which the defendant was convicted.

(4)  Establishment by the defendant of all the criteria of this section does not mandate the granting under this section of probation or modification of the sentence that would otherwise be imposed by Section 76-3-406 regarding sexual offenses against children.

(a)  the nature, frequency, and duration of the conduct;
