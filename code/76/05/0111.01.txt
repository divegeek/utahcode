(6)  The physician-patient privilege does not constitute grounds for excluding evidence regarding a vulnerable adult's injuries, or the cause of those injuries, in any judicial or administrative proceeding resulting from a report made in good faith pursuant to this part.

(7)  An adult is not considered abused, neglected, or a vulnerable adult for the reason that the adult has chosen to rely solely upon religious, nonmedical forms of healing in lieu of medical care.
