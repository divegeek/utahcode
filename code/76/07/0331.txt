76-7-331.   Public funding of abortion forbidden.
(1)  As used in this section, "damage to a major bodily function" refers only
to injury or impairment of a physical nature and may not be interpreted to
mean mental, psychological, or emotional harm, illness, or distress.
(2)  Public funds of the state, its institutions, or its political
subdivisions may not be used to pay or otherwise reimburse, either directly or
indirectly, any person, agency, or facility for the performance of any induced
abortion services unless:
(a)  in the professional judgment of the pregnant woman's attending physician,
the abortion is necessary to save the pregnant woman's life;
(b)  the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest reported to law enforcement
agencies, unless the woman was unable to report the crime for physical reasons
or fear of retaliation; or
(c)  in the professional judgment of the pregnant woman's attending physician,
the abortion is necessary to prevent permanent, irreparable, and grave damage
to a major bodily function of the pregnant woman provided that a caesarian
procedure or other medical procedure that could also save the life of the
child is not a viable option.
(3)  Any officer or employee of the state who knowingly authorizes the use of
funds prohibited by this section shall be dismissed from that person's office
or position and the person's employment shall be immediately terminated.
