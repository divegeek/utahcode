(c) (i)  a medical condition exists that, on the basis of the physician's good faith clinical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant minor as to necessitate the abortion of her pregnancy to avert:

(A)  the minor's death; or

(B)  a serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function of the minor; and

(ii)  there is not sufficient time to obtain the consent in the manner chosen by the minor under Subsection (3) before it is necessary to terminate the minor's pregnancy in order to avert the minor's death or impairment described in Subsection (2)(c)(i).

(5) (a)  A hearing on a petition described in Subsection (4) shall be closed to the public.

(b)  After considering the evidence presented at the hearing, the court shall order that the minor may obtain an abortion without the consent of a parent or guardian of the minor if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that:
