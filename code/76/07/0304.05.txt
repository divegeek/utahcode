(B)  a serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function of the minor; and

(5) (a)  A hearing on a petition described in Subsection (4) shall be closed to the public.

(b)  After considering the evidence presented at the hearing, the court shall order that the minor may obtain an abortion without the consent of a parent or guardian of the minor if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that:
