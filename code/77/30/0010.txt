77-30-10.   Time to apply for habeas corpus allowed.
No person arrested upon such warrant shall be delivered over to the agent whom
the executive authority demanding him shall have appointed to receive him
unless he shall first be taken forthwith before a judge of a court of record
in this state who shall inform him of the demand made for his surrender and of
the crime with which he is charged and that he has the right to demand and
procure legal counsel and if the prisoner or his counsel shall state that he
or they desire to test the legality of his arrest, the judge of such court of
record shall fix a reasonable time to be allowed him within which to apply for
a writ of habeas corpus. When such writ is applied for, notice thereof and the
time and place of hearing thereon shall be given to the prosecuting officer of
the county in which the arrest is made and in which the accused is in custody,
and to the said agent of the demanding state.
