If from the examination before the judge or magistrate it appears that the
person held is the person charged with having committed the crime alleged,
and, except in cases arising under Section 77-30-6 that he has fled from
justice, the judge or magistrate must, by a warrant reciting the accusation,
commit him to the county jail for such a time not exceeding thirty days and
specified in the warrant as will enable the arrest of the accused to be made
under a warrant of the governor on a requisition of the executive authority of

provided in the next section or until he shall be legally discharged.
