77-27-5.   Board of Pardons and Parole authority.

(1) (a)  The Board of Pardons and Parole shall determine by majority decision when and under what conditions, subject to this chapter and other laws of the state, persons committed to serve sentences in class A misdemeanor cases at penal or correctional facilities which are under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections, and all felony cases except treason or impeachment or as otherwise limited by law, may be released upon parole, pardoned, ordered to pay restitution, or have their fines, forfeitures, or restitution remitted, or their sentences commuted or terminated.

(b)  The board may sit together or in panels to conduct hearings.  The chair shall appoint members to the panels in any combination and in accordance with rules promulgated by the board, except in hearings involving commutation and pardons.  The chair may participate on any panel and when doing so is chair of the panel.  The chair of the board may designate the chair for any other panel.

(c)  No restitution may be ordered, no fine, forfeiture, or restitution remitted, no parole, pardon, or commutation granted or sentence terminated, except after a full hearing before the board or the board's appointed examiner in open session.  Any action taken under this subsection other than by a majority of the board shall be affirmed by a majority of the board.

(d)  A commutation or pardon may be granted only after a full hearing before the board.

(e)  The board may determine restitution as provided in Section 77-27-6 and Subsection 77-38a-302(5)(d)(ii).

(2) (a)  In the case of original parole grant hearings, rehearings, and parole revocation hearings, timely prior notice of the time and location of the hearing shall be given to the defendant, the county or district attorney's office responsible for prosecution of the case, the sentencing court, law enforcement officials responsible for the defendant's arrest and conviction, and whenever possible, the victim or the victim's family.

(b)  Notice to the victim, his representative, or his family shall include information provided in Section 77-27-9.5, and any related rules made by the board under that section.  This information shall be provided in terms that are reasonable for the lay person to understand.

(3)  Decisions of the board in cases involving paroles, pardons, commutations or terminations of sentence, restitution, or remission of fines or forfeitures are final and are not subject to judicial review.  Nothing in this section prevents the obtaining or enforcement of a civil judgment, including restitution as provided in Section 77-27-6.

(4)  This chapter may not be construed as a denial of or limitation of the governor's power to grant respite or reprieves in all cases of convictions for offenses against the state, except treason or conviction on impeachment.  However, respites or reprieves may not extend beyond the next session of the Board of Pardons and Parole and the board, at that session, shall continue or terminate the respite or reprieve, or it may commute the punishment, or pardon the offense as provided.  In the case of conviction for treason, the governor may suspend execution of the sentence until the case is reported to the Legislature at its next session.  The Legislature shall then either pardon or commute the sentence, or direct its execution.

(5)  In determining when, where, and under what conditions offenders serving sentences may be paroled, pardoned, have restitution ordered, or have their fines or forfeitures remitted, or their sentences commuted or terminated, the board shall consider whether the persons have made or are prepared to make restitution as ascertained in accordance with the standards and procedures of Section 77-38a-302, as a condition of any parole, pardon, remission of fines or forfeitures, or commutation or termination of sentence.

(6)  In determining whether parole may be terminated, the board shall consider the offense committed by the parolee, the parole period as provided in Section 76-3-202, and in accordance with Section 77-27-13.
