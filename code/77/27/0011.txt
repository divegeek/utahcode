(3)  Any member of the board may issue a warrant based upon a certified warrant request to a peace officer or other persons authorized to arrest, detain, and return to actual custody a parolee, and may upon arrest or otherwise direct the Department of Corrections to determine if there is probable cause to believe that the parolee has violated the conditions of his parole.

(4)  Upon a finding of probable cause, a parolee may be further detained or imprisoned again pending a hearing by the board or its appointed examiner.

(c)  If heard by an appointed examiner, the examiner shall make a written decision which shall include a statement of the facts relied upon by the examiner in determining the guilt or innocence of the parolee on the alleged violation and a conclusion as to whether the alleged violation occurred.  The appointed examiner shall then refer the case to the board for disposition.

(d)  Final decisions shall be reached by majority vote of the members of the board sitting and the parolee shall be promptly notified in writing of the board's findings and decision.

(6)  Parolees found to have violated the conditions of parole may, at the discretion of the board, be returned to parole, have restitution ordered, or be imprisoned again as determined by the board, not to exceed the maximum term, or be subject to any other conditions the board may impose within its discretion.
