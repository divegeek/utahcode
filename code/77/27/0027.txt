77-27-27.   Retaking or reincarceration for parole or probation violations -- Hearing and notice to sending state -- Detention of parolee or probationer.

Where supervision of a parolee or probationer is being administered pursuant to the interstate compact for the supervision of parolees and probationers, the appropriate judicial or administrative authorities in this state shall notify the compact administrator of the sending state whenever, in their view, consideration should be given to retaking or reincarceration for a parole or probation violation. Prior to the giving of any such notification, a hearing shall be held in accordance with this act within a reasonable time, unless such hearing is waived by the parolee or probationer. The appropriate officer or officers of this state shall as soon as practicable, following termination of any hearing, report to the sending state, furnish a copy of the hearing record, and make recommendations regarding the disposition to be made of the parolee or probationer by the sending state. Pending any proceeding pursuant to this section, the appropriate officers of this state may take custody of and detain the parolee or probationer involved for a period not to exceed 15 days prior to the hearing and, if it appears to the hearing officer or officers that retaking or reincarceration is likely to follow, for such reasonable period after the hearing or waiver as may be necessary to arrange for the retaking or reincarceration.
