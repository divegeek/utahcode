77-2a-4.   Violation of plea in abeyance agreement -- Hearing -- Entry of
judgment and imposition of sentence -- Subsequent prosecutions.
(1)  If, at any time during the term of the plea in abeyance agreement,
information comes to the attention of the prosecuting attorney or the court
that the defendant has violated any condition of the agreement, the court, at
the request of the prosecuting attorney, made by appropriate motion and
affidavit, or upon its own motion, may issue an order requiring the defendant
to appear before the court at a designated time and place to show cause why
the court should not find the terms of the agreement to have been violated and
why the agreement should not be terminated.  If, following an evidentiary
hearing, the court finds that the defendant has failed to substantially comply
with any term or condition of the plea in abeyance agreement, it may terminate
the agreement and enter judgment of conviction and impose sentence against the
defendant for the offense to which the original plea was entered. Upon entry
of judgment of conviction and imposition of sentence, any amounts paid by the
defendant as a plea in abeyance fee prior to termination of the agreement
shall be credited against any fine imposed by the court.
(2)  The termination of a plea in abeyance agreement and subsequent entry of
judgment of conviction and imposition of sentence shall not bar any
independent prosecution arising from any offense that constituted a violation
of any term or condition of an agreement whereby the original plea was placed
in abeyance.
