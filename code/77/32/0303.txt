77-32-303.   Standard for court to appoint noncontracting attorney or order the provision of defense resources -- Hearing.

(1)  If a county or municipality has contracted or otherwise provided for a defense services provider, the court may not appoint a noncontracting attorney under this part, Section 78B-1-151, or Rule 15, Utah Rules of Criminal Procedure, unless the court:

(a)  conducts a hearing with proper notice to the county clerk or municipal recorder, with a copy of the notice provided to the prosecutor, to consider the authorization or designation of a noncontract attorney; and

(b)  makes a finding that there is a compelling reason to authorize or designate a noncontracting attorney for the indigent defendant.

(2)  Except as provided in Subsection (3), if a county or municipality has contracted or otherwise provided for a defense services provider, the court may not order under this part, Section 78B-1-151, or Rule 15, Utah Rules of Criminal Procedure, and the county or municipality may not provide defense resources for a defendant who has retained private counsel.

(3)  The court may order, and the county or municipality may provide, defense resources to a defendant represented by private counsel only if:

(a)  the court conducts a hearing with proper notice to the county clerk or municipal recorder, with a copy of the notice provided to the prosecutor;

(b)  the court conducts an in camera review of the defense contract, a full accounting of the defense retainer, anticipated costs of defense resources and other relevant defense records and finds by clear and convincing evidence all of the following:

(i)  the defendant would be prejudiced by the substitution of a contracted defense services provider and any prejudice cannot be remedied by a continuance or other alternative means;

(ii)  at the time of retention of private counsel, the defendant and attorney entered into a written contract which provided that the defendant had the means to pay for fees and defense resources;

(iii)  there has been an unforseen change in circumstances which requires defense resources beyond the defendant's ability to pay; and

(iv)  all of the above representations are made in good faith and are not calculated to allow the defendant or defense attorney to avoid the requirements of this section.

(4)  The court may not order the defense services provider to act as co-counsel with a privately retained legal counsel as a means of circumventing the requirements of this section.
