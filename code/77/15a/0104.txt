(4)  During any examinations under Subsection (3), unless the court directs otherwise, the defendant shall be retained in the same custody or status he was in at the time the examination was ordered.

(5)  The experts shall in the conduct of their examinations and in their reports to the court consider and address:

(a)  whether the defendant is mentally retarded as defined in Section 77-15a-102;

(b)  the degree of any mental retardation the expert finds to exist;

(d)  the degree of any mental deficiencies the expert finds to exist.

(6) (a)  The experts examining the defendant shall provide written reports to the court, the prosecution, and the defense within 60 days of the receipt of the court's order, unless the expert submits to the court a written request for additional time in accordance with Subsection (6)(c).

(c)  The court may call any examiner to testify at the hearing who is not called by the parties.  If the court calls an examiner, counsel for the parties may cross-examine that examiner.

(12) (a)  A defendant is presumed to be not mentally retarded unless the court, by a preponderance of the evidence, finds the defendant to be mentally retarded.  The burden of proof is upon the proponent of mental retardation at the hearing.

(b)  A finding of mental retardation does not operate as an adjudication of mental retardation for any purpose other than exempting the person from a sentence of death in the case before the court.

(13) (a)  The defendant is presumed not to possess the mental deficiencies listed in Subsection 77-15a-101(2) unless the court, by a preponderance of the evidence, finds that the defendant has significant subaverage general intellectual functioning that exists concurrently with significant deficiencies in adaptive functioning and that this functioning was manifested prior to age 22.  The burden of proof is upon the proponent of that proposition.

(b)  If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant has significant subaverage general intellectual functioning that exists concurrently with significant deficiencies in adaptive functioning and that this functioning was manifested prior to age 22, then the burden is upon the state to establish that any confession by the defendant which the state intends to introduce into evidence is supported by substantial evidence independent of the confession.

(14) (a)  If the court finds the defendant mentally retarded, it shall issue an order:

(i)  containing findings of fact and conclusions of law, and addressing each of the factors in Subsections (5)(a) and (b); and

(b)  If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant possesses the mental deficiencies listed in Subsection 77-15a-101(2) and that the state fails to establish that any confession is supported by substantial evidence independent of the confession, the state may proceed with its case and:

(i)  introduce the confession into evidence, and the death penalty will not be a sentencing option in the case; or

(ii)  not introduce into evidence any confession or the fruits of a confession that the court has found is not supported by substantial evidence independent of the confession, and the death penalty will be a sentencing option in the case.

(c) (i)  A finding by the court regarding whether the defendant qualifies for an exemption under Section 77-15a-101 is a final determination of that issue for purposes of this chapter.

(ii)  The following questions may not be submitted to the jury by instruction, special verdict, argument, or other means:

(A)  whether the defendant is mentally retarded for purposes of this chapter; and

(B)  whether the defendant possesses the mental deficiencies specified in Subsection 77-15a-101(2).

(iii)  This chapter does not prevent the defendant from submitting evidence of retardation or other mental deficiency to establish a mental condition as a mitigating circumstance under Section 76-3-207.

(15)  A ruling by the court that the defendant is exempt from the death penalty may be appealed by the state pursuant to Subsection 77-18a-1(2)(h).
