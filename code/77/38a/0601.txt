77-38a-601.   Preservation of assets.
(1)  Prior to or at the time a criminal information, indictment charging a
violation, or a petition alleging delinquency is filed, or at any time during
the prosecution of the case, a prosecutor may, if in the prosecutor's best
judgment there is a substantial likelihood that a conviction will be obtained
and restitution will be ordered in the case, petition the court to:
(a)  enter a temporary restraining order, an injunction, or both;
(b)  require the execution of a satisfactory performance bond; or
(c)  take any other action to preserve the availability of property which may
be necessary to satisfy an anticipated restitution order.
(2) (a)  Upon receiving a request from a prosecutor under Subsection (1), and
after notice to persons appearing to have an interest in the property and
affording them an opportunity to be heard, the court may take action as
requested by the prosecutor if the court determines:
(i)  there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed and
that the defendant committed it, and that failure to enter the order will
likely result in the property being sold, distributed, exhibited, destroyed,
or removed from the jurisdiction of the court, or otherwise be made
unavailable for restitution; and
(ii)  the need to preserve the availability of the property or prevent its
sale, distribution, exhibition, destruction, or removal through the entry of
the requested order outweighs the hardship on any party against whom the order
is to be entered.
(b)  In a hearing conducted pursuant to this section, a court may consider
reliable hearsay as defined in Utah Rules of Evidence, Rule 1102.
(c)  An order for an injunction entered under this section is effective for
the period of time given in the order.
(3) (a)  Upon receiving a request for a temporary restraining order from a
prosecutor under this section, a court may enter a temporary restraining order
against an owner with respect to specific property without notice or
opportunity for a hearing if:
(i)  the prosecutor demonstrates that there is a substantial likelihood that
the property with respect to which the order is sought appears to be necessary
to satisfy an anticipated restitution order under this chapter; and
(ii)  provision of notice would jeopardize the availability of the property to
satisfy any restitution order or judgment.
(b)  The temporary order in this Subsection (3) expires not more than ten days
after it is entered unless extended for good cause shown or the party against
whom it is entered consents to an extension.
(4)  A hearing concerning an order entered under this section shall be held as
soon as possible, and prior to the expiration of the temporary order.
