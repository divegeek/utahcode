77-16a-306.   Continuing review -- Discharge.

(1)  Each entity that provides treatment for a defendant committed to the department as not guilty by reason of insanity under this part shall review the status of each defendant at least once every six months.  If the treatment provider finds that a defendant has recovered from the defendant's mental illness, or, if the defendant has a mental illness, no longer presents a substantial danger to self or others, it shall notify the executive director of its findings.

(2)  Upon receipt of notification under Subsection (1), the executive director shall designate a review team, in accordance with Section 77-16a-304, to evaluate the defendant.  If that review team concurs with the treatment provider's assessment, the executive director shall notify the court, the defendant's attorney, and the prosecuting attorney that the defendant is a candidate for discharge.  The court shall conduct a hearing, in accordance with Section 77-16a-302, within 10 business days after receipt of that notice.

(3)  The court may not discharge an individual whose mental illness is in remission as a result of medication or hospitalization if it can be determined within reasonable medical probability that without continued medication or hospitalization the defendant's mental illness will reoccur, making the defendant a substantial danger to self or others.
