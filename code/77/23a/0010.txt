(e)  The judge, upon filing of a motion, may in the judge's discretion, make available to the person or the person's counsel for inspection the portions of the intercepted communications, applications, and orders the judge determines to be in the interest of justice.

(10)  The contents of any intercepted wire, electronic, or oral communications, or evidence derived from any of these, may not be received in evidence or otherwise disclosed in any trial, hearing, or other proceeding in a federal or state court unless each party, not less than 10 days before the trial, hearing, or proceeding, has been furnished with a copy of the court order, and accompanying application, under which the interception was authorized or approved.  This ten-day period may be waived by the judge if the judge finds that it was not possible to furnish the party with the above information 10 days before the trial, hearing, or proceeding and that the party will not be prejudiced by the delay in receiving the information.

(11) (a)  Any aggrieved person in any trial, hearing, or proceeding in or before any court, department, officer, agency, regulatory body, or other authority of the United States, the state, or a political subdivision may move to suppress the contents of any intercepted wire, electronic, or oral communications, or evidence derived from any of them, on the grounds that:

(c)  In addition to any other right to appeal, the state or its political subdivision may appeal from an order granting a motion to suppress made under Subsection (11)(a), or the denial of an application for an order of approval, if the attorney bringing the appeal certifies to the judge or other official granting the motion or denying the application that the appeal is not taken for the purposes of delay.  The appeal shall be taken within 30 days after the date the order was entered and shall be diligently prosecuted.

(iii)  the judge finds that the purpose has been adequately shown.

(13) (a)  An interception of a communication under an order regarding which the requirements of Subsections (1)(b)(ii), (2)(d), and (3)(b) do not apply by reason of Subsection (12) does not begin until the facilities from which, or the place where, the communications are to be intercepted is ascertained by the person implementing the interception order.
