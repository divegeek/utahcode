(c)  Every order and extension shall contain a provision that the authorization to intercept shall be executed as soon as practicable, shall be conducted so as to minimize the interception of communications not otherwise subject to interception under this chapter, and must terminate upon attainment of the authorized objective, or in any event within 30 days.

(d)  If the intercepted communication is in a code or foreign language, and an expert in that foreign language or code is not reasonably available during the interception period, the minimizing of the interception may be accomplished as soon as practicable after the interception.

(e)  An interception under this chapter may be conducted in whole or in part by government personnel or by an individual under contract with the government and acting under supervision of an investigative or law enforcement officer authorized to conduct the interception.

(6)  When an order authorizing interception is entered under this chapter, the order may require reports to be made to the judge who issued the order, showing what progress has been made toward achievement of the authorized objective and the need for continued interception.  These reports shall be made at intervals the judge may require.

(7)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any investigative or law enforcement officer who is specially designated by either the attorney general, a county attorney or district attorney as provided under Sections 17-18-1 and 17-18-1.7 may intercept wire, electronic, or oral communication if an application for an order approving the interception is made in accordance with this section and within 48 hours after the interception has occurred or begins to occur, when the investigative or law enforcement officer reasonably determines that:

(a)  an emergency situation exists that involves:

(i)  immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person;

(ii)  conspiratorial activities threatening the national security interest; or

(iii)  conspiratorial activities characteristic of organized crime, that require a wire, electronic, or oral communication to be intercepted before an order authorizing interception can, with diligence, be obtained; and

(b)  there are grounds upon which an order could be entered under this chapter to authorize the interception.

(8) (a)  In the absence of an order under Subsection (7), the interception immediately terminates when the communication sought is obtained or when the application for the order is denied, whichever is earlier.

(b)  If the application for approval is denied, or in any other case where the interception is terminated without an order having been issued, the contents of any wire, electronic, or oral communication intercepted shall be treated as having been obtained in violation of this chapter, and an inventory shall be served as provided for in Subsection (9)(d) on the person named in the application.

(9) (a)  The contents of any wire, electronic, or oral communication intercepted by any means authorized by this chapter shall, if possible, be recorded on tape or wire or other comparable device.

Duplicate recordings may be made for use or disclosure under Subsections 77-23a-9(1) and (2) for investigations.  The presence of the seal provided by this Subsection (9)(a), or a satisfactory explanation for the absence of one, is a prerequisite for the use or disclosure of the contents of any wire, electronic, or oral communication or evidence derived from it under Subsection 77-23a-9(3).

(b)  Applications made and orders granted under this chapter shall be sealed by the judge.  Custody of the applications and orders shall be where the judge directs.  The applications and orders shall be disclosed only upon a showing of good cause before a judge of competent jurisdiction and may not be destroyed, except on order of the issuing or denying judge.  But in any event they shall be kept for 10 years.

(c)  Any violation of any provision of this subsection may be punished as contempt of the issuing or denying judge.

(d)  Within a reasonable time, but not later than 90 days after the filing of an application for an order of approval under Subsection 77-23a-10(7) that is denied or the termination of the period of an order or extensions, the issuing or denying judge shall cause to be served on the persons named in the order or the application, and other parties to the intercepted communications as the judge determines in his discretion is in the interest of justice, an inventory, which shall include notice of:

(i)  the entry of the order or application;

(ii)  the date of the entry and the period of authorization, approved or disapproved interception, or the denial of the application; and

(iii)  that during the period wire, electronic, or oral communications were or were not intercepted.

(e)  The judge, upon filing of a motion, may in his discretion make available to the person or his counsel for inspection the portions of the intercepted communications, applications, and orders the judge determines to be in the interest of justice.  On an ex parte showing of good cause to a judge of competent jurisdiction the serving of the inventory required by this Subsection (9)(e) may be postponed.

(10)  The contents of any intercepted wire, electronic, or oral communication, or evidence derived from any of them, may not be received in evidence or otherwise disclosed in any trial, hearing, or other proceeding in a federal or state court unless each party, not less than 10 days before the trial, hearing, or proceeding, has been furnished with a copy of the court order, and accompanying application, under which the interception was authorized or approved.  This ten-day period may be waived by the judge if he finds that it was not possible to furnish the party with the above information 10 days before the trial, hearing, or proceeding and that the party will not be prejudiced by the delay in receiving the information.

(11) (a)  Any aggrieved person in any trial, hearing, or proceeding in or before any court, department, officer, agency, regulatory body, or other authority of the United States, the state, or a political subdivision may move to suppress the contents of any intercepted wire, electronic, or oral communication, or evidence derived from any of them, on the grounds that:

(i)  the communication was unlawfully intercepted;

(ii)  the order of authorization or approval under which it was intercepted is insufficient on its face; or

(iii)  the interception was not made in conformity with the order of authorization or approval.

(b)  The motion shall be made before the trial, hearing, or proceeding unless there was no opportunity to make the motion or the person was not aware of the grounds of the motion.  If the motion is granted, the contents of the intercepted wire, electronic, or oral communication, or evidence derived from any of them, shall be treated as having been obtained in violation of this chapter.  The judge, upon the filing of the motion by the aggrieved person, may in his discretion make available to the aggrieved person or his counsel for inspection portions of the intercepted communication or evidence derived from them as the judge determines to be in the interests of justice.

(c)  In addition to any other right to appeal, the state or its political subdivision may appeal from an order granting a motion to suppress made under Subsection (11)(a), or the denial of an application for an order of approval, if the attorney bringing the appeal certifies to the judge or other official granting the motion or denying the application that the appeal is not taken for the purposes of delay.  The appeal shall be taken within 30 days after the date the order was entered and shall be diligently prosecuted.

(12)  The requirements of Subsections (1)(b)(ii), (2)(d), and (3)(b) relating to the specification of the facilities from which, or the place where, the communication is to be intercepted do not apply if:

(a)  in the case of an applicant regarding the interception of an oral communication:

(i)  the application is by a law enforcement officer and is approved by the state attorney general, a deputy attorney general, a county attorney or district attorney, or a deputy county attorney or deputy district attorney;

(ii)  the application contains a full and complete statement of why the specification is not practical, and identifies the person committing the offense and whose communications are to be intercepted; or

(iii)  the judge finds that the specification is not practical; and

(b)  in the case of an application regarding wire or electronic communication:

(i)  the application is by a law enforcement officer and is approved by the state attorney general, a deputy attorney general, a county attorney or district attorney, or a deputy county attorney or deputy district attorney;

(ii)  the application identifies the person believed to be committing the offense and whose communications are to be intercepted, and the applicant makes a showing of a purpose, on the part of that person, to thwart interception by changing facilities; and

(iii)  the judge finds that the purpose has been adequately shown.

(13) (a)  An interception of a communication under an order regarding which the requirements of Subsections (1)(b)(ii), (2)(d), and (3)(b) do not apply by reason of Subsection (12), does not begin until the facilities from which, or the place where, the communication is to be intercepted is ascertained by the person implementing the interception order.

(b)  A provider of wire or electronic communications service that has received an order under Subsection (12)(b) may move the court to modify or quash the order on the ground that its assistance with respect to the interception cannot be performed in a timely or reasonable fashion.  The court, upon notice to the government, shall decide the motion expeditiously.
