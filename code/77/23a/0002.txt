77-23a-2.   Legislative findings.
The Legislature finds and determines that:
(1)  Wire communications are normally conducted through facilities which form
part of an interstate network. The same facilities are used for interstate and
intrastate communications.
(2)  In order to protect effectively the privacy of wire and oral
communications, to protect the integrity of court and administrative
proceedings, and to prevent the obstruction of intrastate commerce, it is
necessary for the legislature to define the circumstances and conditions under
which the interception of wire and oral communications may be authorized and
to prohibit any unauthorized interception of these communications and the use
of the contents thereof in evidence in courts and administrative proceedings.
(3)  Organized criminals make extensive use of wire and oral communications in
their criminal activities. The interception of such communications to obtain
evidence of the commission of crimes or to prevent their commission is an
indispensable aid to law enforcement and the administration of justice.
(4)  To safeguard the privacy of innocent persons, the interception of wire or
oral communications when none of the parties to the communication has
consented to the interception should be allowed only when authorized by a
court of competent jurisdiction and should remain under the control and
supervision of the authorizing court. Interception of wire and oral
communications should further be limited to certain major types of offenses
and specific categories of crime with assurance that the interception is
justified and that the information obtained thereby will not be misused.
