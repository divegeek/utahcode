ARTICLE IV
PROCEDURES AND RIGHTS
(a)  Whenever the duly constituted authorities in a state party to this
Compact, and which has entered into a contract pursuant to Article III, shall
decide that confinement in, or transfer of an inmate to, an institution within
the territory of another party state is necessary or desirable in order to
provide adequate quarters and care of an appropriate program of rehabilitation
or treatment, said officials may direct that the confinement be within an
institution with the territory of said other party state, the receiving state
to act in that regard solely as agent for the sending state.
(b)  The appropriate officials of any state party to this Compact shall have
access, at all reasonable times, to any institution in which it has a
contractual right to confine inmates for the purpose of inspecting the
facilities thereof and visiting such of its inmates as may be confined in the
institution.
(c)  Inmates confined in an institution pursuant to the terms of this Compact
shall at all times be subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state and may
at any time be removed therefrom for transfer to a prison or other institution
within the sending state, for transfer to another institution in which the
sending state may have a contractual or other right to confine inmates, for
release on probation or parole, for discharge, or for any other purpose
permitted by the laws of the sending state; provided, that the sending state
shall continue to be obligated to such payments as may be required pursuant to
the terms of any contract entered into under the terms of Article III.
(d)  Each receiving state shall provide regular reports to each sending state
on the inmates of that sending state in institutions pursuant to this Compact
including a conduct record of each inmate and certify said record to the
official designated by the sending state, in order that each inmate may have
official review of his or her record in determining and altering the
disposition of said inmate in accordance with the law which may obtain in the
sending state and in order that the same may be a source of information for
the sending state.
(e)  All inmates who may be confined in an institution pursuant to the
provisions of this Compact shall be treated in a reasonable and humane manner
and shall be treated equally with such similar inmates of the receiving state
as may be confined in the same institution. The fact of confinement in a
receiving state shall not deprive any inmate so confined of any legal rights
which said inmate would have had if confined in an appropriate institution of
the sending state.
(f)  Any hearing or hearings to which an inmate confined pursuant to this
Compact may be entitled by the laws of the sending state may be had before the
appropriate authorities of the sending state, or of the receiving state, if
authorized by the sending state. The receiving state shall provide adequate
facilities for such hearings as may be conducted by the appropriate officials
of a sending state. In the event such hearing or hearings are had before
officials of the receiving state, the governing law shall be that of the
sending state and a record of the hearing or hearings as prescribed by the
sending state shall be made. Said record together with any recommendations of
the hearing officials shall be transmitted forthwith to the official or
officials before whom the hearing would have been had if it had taken place in
the sending state. In any and all proceedings had pursuant to the provisions
of this subdivision, the officials of the receiving state shall act solely as
agents of the sending state and no final determination shall be made in any
matter except by the appropriate officials of the sending state.
(g)  Any inmate confined pursuant to this Compact shall be released within the
territory of the sending state unless the inmate, and the sending and
receiving states, shall agree upon release in some other place. The sending
state shall bear the cost of such return to its territory.
(h)  Any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this Compact shall have any
and all rights to participate in and derive any benefits or incur or be
relieved of any obligations or have such obligations modified or his status
changed on account of any action or proceeding in which he could have
participated if confined in any appropriate institution of the sending state
located within such state.
(i)  The parent, guardian, trustee, or other person or persons entitled under
the laws of the sending state to act for, advise, or otherwise function with
respect to any inmate shall not be deprived of or restricted in his exercise
of any powers in respect of any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this
Compact.
ARTICLE V
ACTS NOT REVIEWABLE IN RECEIVING STATE: EXTRADITION
(a)  Any decision of the sending state in respect of any matter over which it
retains jurisdiction pursuant to this Compact shall be conclusive upon and not
reviewable within the receiving state, but if at the time the sending state
seeks to remove an inmate from an institution in the receiving state there is
pending against the inmate within such state any criminal charge or if the
inmate is formally accused of having committed within such state a criminal
offense, the inmate shall not be returned without the consent of the receiving
state until discharged from prosecution or other form of proceeding,
imprisonment or detention for such offense. The duly accredited officers of
the sending state shall be permitted to transport inmates pursuant to this
Compact through any and all states party to this Compact without interference.
(b)  An inmate who escapes from an institution in which he is confined
pursuant to this Compact shall be deemed a fugitive from the sending state and
from the state in which the institution is situated. In the case of an escape
to a jurisdiction other than the sending or receiving state, the
responsibility for institution of extradition or rendition proceedings shall
be that of the sending state, but nothing contained herein shall be construed
to prevent or affect the activities of officers and agencies of any
jurisdiction directed toward the apprehension and return of an escapee.
ARTICLE VI
FEDERAL AID
Any state party to this Compact may accept federal aid for use in connection
with any institution or program, the use of which is or may be affected by
this Compact or any contract pursuant hereto and any inmate in a receiving
state pursuant to this Compact may participate in any such federally aided
program or activity for which the sending and receiving states have made
contractual provision; provided, that if such program or activity is not part
of the customary correctional regimen the express consent of the appropriate
official of the sending state shall be required therefor.
ARTICLE VII
ENTRY INTO FORCE
This Compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding upon the
states so acting when it has been enacted into law by any two states.
Thereafter, this Compact shall enter into force and become effective and
binding as to any other of said states upon similar action by such state.
ARTICLE VIII
WITHDRAWAL AND TERMINATION
This Compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon a party state
until it shall have enacted a statute repealing the same and providing for the
sending of formal written notice of withdrawal from the Compact to the
appropriate officials of all other party states. An actual withdrawal shall
not take effect until one year after the notices provided in said statute have
been sent. Such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing state from its
obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
Before the effective date of withdrawal, a withdrawing state shall remove to
its territory, at its own expense, such inmates as it may have confined
pursuant to the provisions of this Compact.
ARTICLE IX
OTHER ARRANGEMENTS UNAFFECTED
Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to abrogate or impair any
agreement or other arrangement which a party state may have with a non-party
state for the confinement, rehabilitation or treatment of inmates nor to
repeal any other laws of a party state authorizing the making of co-operative
institutional arrangements.
ARTICLE X
CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
The provisions of this Compact shall be liberally construed and shall be
severable. If any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact is
declared to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state or of
the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency,
person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this
Compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or
circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this Compact shall be held
contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, the Compact
shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full
force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.

made pursuant to Article IV.
