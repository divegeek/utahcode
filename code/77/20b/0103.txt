77-20b-103.   Defendant in custody -- Notice to prosecutor.

defendant is and will be in the custody of authorities of another
jurisdiction, the surety shall notify the court and the prosecutor and provide
the name, address, and telephone number of the custodial authority.
(2)  If the defendant is subject to extradition or other means by which the
state can return the defendant to the court's custody, and the surety gives
notice under Subsection (1), the surety's bond shall be exonerated:
(a)  if the prosecutor elects in writing not to extradite the defendant
immediately; and
(b)  if the prosecutor elects in writing to extradite the defendant, to the
extent the bond exceeds the reasonable, actual, or estimated costs to
extradite and return the defendant to the court's custody, upon the occurrence
of the earlier of:
(i)  the prosecuting attorney's lodging a detainer on the defendant; or
(ii)  60 days after the surety gives notice to the prosecutor under Subsection
(1), if the defendant remains in custody of the same authority during that
