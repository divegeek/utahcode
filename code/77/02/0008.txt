77-2-8.   Violation of diversion agreement -- Hearing -- Prosecution
resumed.
If, during the course of the diversion of a defendant, information is brought
to the attention of a magistrate or the prosecuting attorney that the
defendant has violated his diversion agreement and it appears in the best
interests of the community to reinstate and proceed with the prosecution, the
prosecuting attorney, upon court approval, or the magistrate, on his own
motion, shall cause to be served upon the defendant an order to show cause
specifying the facts relied upon by the prosecuting attorney or magistrate to
terminate diversion and shall set a time and place for a hearing to determine
whether or not the defendant has violated his diversion agreement. If, at the
hearing, the magistrate finds the defendant has failed to comply with any
terms or conditions of the diversion agreement, he may authorize the
prosecuting attorney to proceed with prosecution.  The prosecution of a
diverted offense shall not bar any independent prosecution arising from any
offense that constituted a violation of any term or condition of the diversion
agreement by which the original prosecution was diverted.
