obtaining the contents of communications, records, or other information under

providing the information a  reimbursement fee for the costs reasonably
necessary and  directly incurred in searching for, assembling, reproducing, or
otherwise providing the information.
(b)  The reimbursement costs shall include any costs due to the necessary
disruption of normal operations of any electronic communications service or
remote computing service in which the information may be stored.
(2)  The fee amount under Subsection (1) shall be mutually agreed upon by the
governmental entity and the person or entity providing the information, or in
the absence of agreement, shall be as determined by the court:
