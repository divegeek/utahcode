77-21-3.   Procedure to secure attendance of witness from without state.
If a person in any state, which by its laws has made provision for commanding
persons within its borders to attend and testify in criminal prosecutions, or
grand jury investigations commenced or about to commence, in this state, is a
material witness in a prosecution pending in a court of record in this state,
or in a grand jury investigation which has commenced or is about to commence,
a judge of the court may issue a certificate under the seal of the court
stating these facts and specifying the number of days the witness will be
required. The certificate may include a recommendation that the witness be
taken into immediate custody and delivered to an officer of this state to
assure his attendance in this state. This certificate shall be presented to a
judge of a court of record in the county in which the witness is found.
If the witness is summoned to attend and testify in this state he shall be
tendered such sum as may be required by the laws of the state in which the
witness is found, not exceeding the sum of 20 cents a mile for each mile by
the ordinary traveled route to and from the court where the prosecution is
pending and $30 for each day that he is required to travel and attend as a
witness. A witness who has appeared in accordance with the provisions of the
summons shall not be required to remain within this state a longer period of
time than the period mentioned in the certificate unless otherwise ordered by
the court. If the witness, after coming into this state, fails without good
cause to attend and testify as directed in the summons, he shall be punished
in the manner provided for the punishment of any witness who disobeys a
summons issued from a court of record in this state.
