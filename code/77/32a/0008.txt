77-32a-8.   Default in payment as contempt -- What constitutes contempt -- Imprisonment.

Unless the defendant shows that his default was not attributable to an intentional refusal to obey the order of the court or to a failure on his part to make a good faith effort to make the payment, the court may find that his default constitutes contempt and may order him committed until the costs or a specified part thereof, are paid.
