77-32a-3.   Ability to pay considered.
The court shall not include in the judgment a sentence that a defendant pay
costs unless the defendant is or will be able to pay them. In determining the
amount and method of payment of costs, the court shall take account of the
financial resources of the defendant and the nature of the burden that payment
of costs will impose and that restitution be the first priority.
