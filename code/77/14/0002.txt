(1) A defendant, whether or not written demand has been made, who intends to
offer evidence of an alibi shall, not less than 10 days before trial or at
such other time as the court may allow, file and serve on the prosecuting
attorney a notice, in writing, of his intention to claim alibi. The notice
shall contain specific information as to the place where the defendant claims
to have been at the time of the alleged offense and, as particularly as is
known to the defendant or his attorney, the names and addresses of the
witnesses by whom he proposes to establish alibi. The prosecuting attorney,
not more than five days after receipt of the list provided herein or at such
other time as the court may direct, shall file and serve the defendant with
the addresses, as particularly as are known to him, of the witnesses the state
proposes to offer to contradict or impeach the defendant's alibi evidence.
(2)  The defendant and prosecuting attorney shall be under a continuing duty
to disclose the names and addresses of additional witnesses which come to the
attention of either party after filing their alibi witness lists.
(3)  If a defendant or prosecuting attorney fails to comply with the
requirements of this section, the court may exclude evidence offered to
establish or rebut alibi. However, the defendant may always testify on his own
behalf concerning alibi.
(4)  The court may, for good cause shown, waive the requirements of this
section.
