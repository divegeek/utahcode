From a judgment of removal an appeal may be taken to the Supreme Court in the same manner as from a judgment in a civil action; but from entry of judgment and until the judgment is reversed, the defendant shall be suspended from his office. Pending the appeal, the office shall be filled as in the case of a vacancy.
