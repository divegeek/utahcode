When articles of impeachment are presented to the Senate, and the officer has been served with a copy of the articles, he shall be temporarily suspended from his office and may not exercise his duties until he is acquitted.  Upon the suspension of any officer, other than the governor, or a justice or judge of a court of record, his office shall be temporarily filled by an appointment made by the governor, with the consent of the Senate, until the acquittal of the party impeached, or, in the case of his removal, until the vacancy is filled at the next election as provided by law.
