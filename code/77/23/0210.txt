77-23-210.   Force used in executing warrant -- When notice of authority is
required as a prerequisite.
When a search warrant has been issued authorizing entry into any building,
room, conveyance, compartment, or other enclosure, the officer executing the
warrant may use such force as is reasonably necessary to enter:
(1)  if, after notice of the officer's authority and purpose, there is no
response or the officer is not admitted with reasonable promptness; or
(2)  without notice of the officer's authority and purpose, if the magistrate
issuing the warrant directs in the warrant that the officer need not give
notice.
