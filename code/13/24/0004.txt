13-24-4.   Damages.
(1)  Except to the extent that a material and prejudicial change of position
prior to acquiring knowledge or reason to know of misappropriation renders a
monetary recovery inequitable, a complainant is entitled to recover damages
for misappropriation.  Damages can include both the actual loss caused by
misappropriation and the unjust enrichment caused by misappropriation that is
not taken into account in computing actual loss.  In lieu of damages measured
by any other methods, the damages caused by misappropriation may be measured
by imposition of liability for a reasonable royalty for a misappropriator's
unauthorized disclosure or use of a trade secret.
(2)  If willful and malicious misappropriation exists, the court may award
exemplary damages in an amount not exceeding twice any award made under
Subsection (1).
