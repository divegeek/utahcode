The most effective way to protect children on the Internet is to supervise use and review all email messages and other correspondence.  Under law, theft of a contact point from the Child Protection Registry is a second degree felony.  While every attempt will be made to secure the Child Protection Registry, registrants and their guardians should be aware that their contact points may be at a greater risk of being misappropriated by marketers who choose to disobey the law."
