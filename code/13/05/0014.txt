13-5-14.   Injunctive relief -- Damages -- Immunity.
Any person or the state of Utah may maintain an action to enjoin a continuance
of any act in violation of this chapter, and, if injured by the act, for the
recovery of damages. If, in such action, the court finds that the defendant is
violating or has violated any of the provisions of this chapter, it shall
enjoin the defendant from a continuance of the violation. It is not necessary
that actual damages to the plaintiff be alleged or proved. In addition to such
injunctive relief, the plaintiff is entitled to recover from the defendant
three times the amount of the actual damages sustained or $2,000, whichever is
greater, plus court costs.
Any defendant in an action brought under this section may be required to
testify. The books and records of such defendant may be brought into court and
introduced, by reference, into evidence. No information so obtained may be
used against the defendant as a basis for a misdemeanor prosecution under this
chapter.
