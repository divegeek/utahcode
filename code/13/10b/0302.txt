The owner or employee of a motion picture theater who advises a law enforcement agency of an alleged violation of this section is not liable in any civil action that arises out of detaining an individual under Section 13-10b-301 whom the owner or employee reasonably believes to have violated Section 13-10b-201, unless the plaintiff shows by clear and convincing evidence that the measures were manifestly unreasonable or the period of detention was unreasonably long.
