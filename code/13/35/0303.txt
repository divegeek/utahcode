13-35-303.   Effect of terminating a franchise.

If under Section 13-35-301 the executive director permits a franchisor to terminate or not continue a franchise and prohibits the franchisor from entering into a franchise for the sale of new powersport vehicles of a line-make in a relevant market area, the franchisor may not enter into a franchise for the sale of new powersport vehicles of that line-make in the specified relevant market area unless the executive director determines, after a recommendation by the advisory board, that there has been a change of circumstances so that the relevant market area at the time of the establishment of the new franchise agreement can reasonably be expected to support the new franchisee.
