(iii)  For the purpose of an arbitration conducted under this section, if the dispute to be arbitrated is not already the subject of legal action, the district court having jurisdiction over the county where the private property involved in the dispute is located is the court referred to in Title 78B, Chapter 11, Utah Uniform Arbitration Act.

(iv)  An arbitration award under this chapter may not be vacated under the provisions of Subsection 78B-11-124(1)(e) because of the lack of an arbitration agreement between the parties.
