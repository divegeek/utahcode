(iii)  the pawnbroker has complied with the requirements of Section 13-32a-106 regarding reporting to the central database and Section 13-32a-103.

(b)  If an article, including scrap jewelry, is purchased by a pawn or secondhand business or a coin dealer, the pawn or secondhand business or coin dealer may sell the article after the pawn or secondhand business or coin dealer has held the article for 15 days and complied with the requirements of Section 13-32a-106 regarding reporting to the central database and Section 13-32a-103, except that pawn, secondhand, and coin dealer businesses are not required to hold precious metals or coins under this Subsection (1)(b).

(c)  This Subsection (1) does not preclude a law enforcement agency from requiring a pawn or secondhand business to hold an article if necessary in the course of an investigation.

(4)  The initial hold by a law enforcement agency is for a period of 90 days.

The law enforcement agency shall respond within 30 days by:

(a)  confirming that the holding period has expired and that the pawn or secondhand business may manage the item as if acquired in the ordinary course of business; or

(a)  personally delivered to the pawn or secondhand business with a signed receipt of delivery;

(b)  delivered to the pawn or secondhand business by registered or certified mail; or

(c)  delivered by any other means with the mutual assent of the law enforcement agency and the pawn or secondhand business.
