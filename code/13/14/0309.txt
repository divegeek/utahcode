13-14-309.   Change in distribution plan.
If there is a change in the plan of distribution of a line make that
contemplates a continuation of that line make in the state, a manufacturer or
distributor may not directly or indirectly, through the action of any parent
of the manufacturer or distributor, subsidiary of the manufacturer or
distributor, or common entity cause a termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal
of a dealer franchise agreement by a present or previous manufacturer or
distributor unless, by the effective date of the action the manufacturer or
distributor offers the new motor vehicle dealer whose dealer franchise
agreement is terminated, cancelled, or not renewed, a dealer franchise
agreement that is substantially similar to the dealer franchise agreement that
existed with the previous manufacturer or distributor allowing the dealer to
represent the line make under the new plan of distribution.
