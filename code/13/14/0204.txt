(b)  pay the franchisee the cost of the part.

(6) (a)  A claim made by a franchisee pursuant to this section for labor and parts shall be paid within 30 days after its approval.

(b)  A claim shall be either approved or disapproved by the franchisor within 30 days after receipt of the claim on a form generally used by the franchisor and containing the generally required information.  Any claim not specifically disapproved of in writing within 30 days after the receipt of the form is considered to be approved and payment shall be made within 30 days.

(7)  Warranty service audits of franchisee records may be conducted by the franchisor on a reasonable basis.

(8)  A franchisee's claim for warranty compensation may be denied only if:

(a)  the franchisee's claim is based on a nonwarranty repair;

(b)  the franchisee lacks material documentation for the claim;

(c)  the franchisee fails to comply materially with specific substantive terms and conditions of the franchisor's warranty compensation program; or

(d)  the franchisor has a bona fide belief based on competent evidence that the franchisee's claim is intentionally false, fraudulent, or misrepresented.

(9) (a)  Any charge backs for warranty parts or service compensation and service incentives shall only be enforceable for the six-month period immediately following the date the payment for warranty reimbursement was made by the franchisor.

(b)  Except as provided in Subsection (9)(c), all charge backs levied by a franchisor for sales compensation or sales incentives arising out of the sale or lease of a motor vehicle sold or leased by a franchisee shall be compensable only if written notice of the charge back is received by the franchisee within six months immediately following the sooner of:

(i)  the date when the sales incentive program terminates; or

(ii)  the date when payment for the sales compensation or sales incentive was made by the franchisor to the franchisee.

(c) (i)  Upon an audit, the franchisor shall provide the franchisee automated or written notice explaining the amount of and reason for a charge back.

(A)  explain a deficiency; or

(B)  provide materials or information to correct and cure compliance with a provision that is a basis for a charge back.

(d)  A charge back:

(i)  may not be based on a nonmaterial error that is clerical in nature; and

(ii) (A)  shall be based on one or more specific instances of material noncompliance with the franchisor's warranty compensation program or sales incentive program; and

(B)  may not be extrapolated from a sampling of warranty claims or sales incentive claims.

(e)  The time limitations of this Subsection (9) do not preclude charge backs for any fraudulent claim that was previously paid.
