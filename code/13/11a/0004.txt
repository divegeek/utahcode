the defendant is violating or has violated any of the provisions of this

(4)  The remedies of this section are in addition to remedies otherwise
available for the same conduct under state or local law.
(5)  No action for injunctive relief may be brought for a violation of this
chapter unless the complaining person first gives notice of the alleged
violation to the prospective defendant and provides the prospective defendant
an opportunity to promulgate a correction notice by the same media as the
allegedly violating advertisement.  If the prospective defendant does not
promulgate a correction notice within 10 days of receipt of the notice, the
complaining person may file a lawsuit under this chapter.
