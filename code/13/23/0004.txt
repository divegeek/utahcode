13-23-4.   Rescission.
(1)  A consumer may rescind a contract for the purchase of health spa services
if he enters into the contract and gives value at a time when the health spa
is not fully operational and available for use, and if the health spa does not
become fully operational and available for use within 60 days after the date
of the contract.
(2)  A consumer's right to rescind his contract under this section continues
for three business days after the health spa becomes fully operational and
available for use.
(3)  A consumer who rescinds his contract under this section is entitled to a
refund of any payments he has made, less the reasonable value of any health
spa services he actually received or $25, whichever is less.  The preparation
and processing of the contract and other documents are not considered to be
health spa services that are deductible under this subsection from any
refundable amount.
(4)  Any rescission of a contract under this section is effective upon the
health spa's receipt of written notice of the consumer's intent to rescind the
contract.  The notice may be delivered by hand or mailed by certified mail
postmarked no later than midnight of the third day after the health spa
becomes fully operational and available for use.
