individuals with whom it has agreements.  If the denial is affirmed, subject
to the administrator's order and Section 13-42-134, the applicant shall

agreements to another registered provider or returns to the individuals all
unexpended money that is under the applicant's control.

posed by a provider meeting the stated requirements against any continued need
for insurance against employee and director dishonesty.
