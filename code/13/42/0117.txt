assistance by a toll-free communication system or in person to discuss the
financial analysis and plan required by Subsection (2); and

known by the provider to be creditors of the individual, provide the
individual with a list of:

ask the provider about other ways, including bankruptcy, to deal with
indebtedness;

rating or credit scores;
(d)  that nonpayment of debt may lead creditors to increase finance and other
charges or undertake collection activity, including litigation;
(e)  unless it is not true, that the provider may receive compensation from
the creditors of the individual; and
(f)  that, unless the individual is insolvent, if a creditor settles for less
than the full amount of the debt, the plan may result in the creation of
taxable income to the individual, even though the individual does not receive
any money.
(5)  If a provider may receive payments from an individual's creditors and the
plan contemplates that the individual's creditors will reduce finance charges
or fees for late payment, default, or delinquency, the provider may comply
