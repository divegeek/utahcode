(2)  prohibiting, directly or indirectly, the right of free association among dealers for any lawful purpose;

(a)  where the alleged grounds are voluntary abandonment by the dealer of the marketing agreement relationship in which event the aforementioned written notice shall be given five business days in advance of such termination, cancellation, or failure to renew; and

(b)  where the alleged grounds are caused by the conviction of the dealer or distributor in a court of competent jurisdiction of a criminal offense directly related to the business conducted pursuant to the marketing agreement, or the bankruptcy of the dealer or distributor, in which event the aforementioned termination, cancellation, or failure to renew may be effective immediately following such conviction or bankruptcy;

(c)  where the alleged grounds are:
