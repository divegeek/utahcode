13-12-4.   Cancellation provisions -- Dealer or distributor -- Time limit to
exercise.
(1)  Every dealer or distributor shall have the right, which may not be
waived, to cancel his marketing agreement until midnight of the seventh
business day after the day on which the buyer signs the marketing agreement
or, if that agreement is oral, after the day on which the buyer agrees
thereto.
(2)  Notice of cancellation shall be deemed to have been given when it is
addressed to the distributor's or refiner's last known address, postage
prepaid, and certified with a return receipt requested.
(3)  Unless within 10 days after delivery of that notice of cancellation the
dealer returns to the distributor or refiner any money, equipment or
merchandise loaned, sold or delivered to the dealer and delivers up full
possession of the business location to the distributor or refiner, that notice
of cancellation shall be null and void ab initio.
(4) (a)  Except as provided in this subsection, within 10 days after notice of
cancellation is delivered to him, the distributor or refiner shall tender to
the buyer any payments made by the buyer and any note or other evidence of
indebtedness.
(b)  If the down payment includes goods traded in, the goods shall be tendered
in substantially as good condition as when received by the distributor or
refiner.  If the distributor or refiner fails to tender the goods as provided
by this subsection, the dealer may elect to recover an amount equal to the
allowance established by their agreement.
(c)  Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection (3) until the distributor or
refiner has complied with the obligations imposed by this subsection, the
dealer may retain possession of goods delivered to him by the distributor or
refiner and has a lien on the goods in his possession or control for any
recovery to which he is entitled.
