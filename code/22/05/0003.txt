22-5-3.   Registration of security in the name of a fiduciary.
A corporation or transfer agent registering a security in the name of a person
who is a fiduciary or who is described as a fiduciary is not bound to inquire
into the existence, extent, or correct description of the fiduciary
relationship, and thereafter the corporation and its transfer agent may assume
without inquiry that the newly registered owner continues to be the fiduciary
until the corporation or transfer agent receives written notice that the
fiduciary is no longer acting as such with respect to the particular security.
