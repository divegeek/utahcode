22-5-6.   Adverse claims to transfer of security by a fiduciary -- Notice.
(1)  A person asserting a claim of beneficial interest adverse to the transfer
of a security pursuant to an assignment by a fiduciary may give the
corporation or transfer agent written notice of the claim. The corporation or
transfer agent is not put on notice unless the written notice identifies the
claimant, the registered owner and the issue of which the security is a part,
provides an address for communications directed to the claimant and is
received before the transfer. Nothing in this act relieves the corporation or
transfer agent of any liability for making or refusing to make the transfer
after it is so put on notice, unless it proceeds in the manner authorized in
Subsection (2).
(2)  As soon as practicable after the presentation of a security for transfer
pursuant to an assignment by a fiduciary, a corporation or transfer agent
which has received notice of a claim of beneficial interest adverse to the
transfer may send notice of the presentation by registered or certified mail
to the claimant at the address given by him. If the corporation or transfer
agent so mails such a notice it shall withhold the transfer for 30 days after
the mailing and shall then make the transfer unless restrained by a court
order.
