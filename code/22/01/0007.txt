22-1-7.   Bank deposits in name of fiduciary.
If a deposit is made in a bank to the credit of a fiduciary as such, the bank
is authorized to pay the amount of the deposit or any part thereof upon the
check of the fiduciary, signed with the name in which such deposit is entered,
without being liable to the principal, unless the bank pays the check with
actual knowledge that the fiduciary is committing a breach of his obligation
as fiduciary in drawing the check, or with knowledge of such facts that its
action in paying the check amounts to bad faith. If, however, such a check is
payable to the drawee bank and is delivered to it in payment of, or as
security for, a personal debt of the fiduciary to it, the bank is liable to
the principal, if the fiduciary in fact commits a breach of his obligation as
fiduciary in drawing or delivering the check.
