If a check or other bill of exchange is drawn by a fiduciary as such, or in
the name of his principal by a fiduciary empowered to draw such instrument in
the name of his principal, payable to the fiduciary personally, or payable to
a third person and by him transferred to the fiduciary, and is thereafter
transferred by the fiduciary, whether in payment of a personal debt of the
fiduciary or otherwise, the transferee is not bound to inquire whether the
fiduciary is committing a breach of his obligation as fiduciary in

fiduciary is committing a breach of his obligation as fiduciary, unless he
takes the instrument with actual knowledge of such breach or with knowledge of
such facts that his action in taking the instrument amounts to bad faith.
