22-1-5.   Checks -- Drawn by fiduciaries, payable to third persons.
If a check or other bill of exchange is drawn by a fiduciary as such, or in
the name of his principal by a fiduciary empowered to draw such instrument in
the name of his principal, the payee is not bound to inquire whether the
fiduciary is committing a breach of his obligation as fiduciary in drawing or
delivering the instrument, and is not chargeable with notice that the
fiduciary is committing a breach of his obligation as fiduciary, unless he
takes the instrument with actual knowledge of such breach or with knowledge of
such facts that his action in taking the instrument amounts to bad faith. If,
however, such instrument is payable to a personal creditor of the fiduciary
and delivered to the creditor in payment of, or as security for, a personal
debt of the fiduciary to the actual knowledge of the creditor, or is drawn and
delivered in any transaction known by the payee to be for the personal benefit
of the fiduciary, the creditor or other payee is liable to the principal, if
the fiduciary in fact commits a breach of his obligation as fiduciary in
drawing or delivering the instrument.
