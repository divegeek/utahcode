22-3-411.   Receipts normally apportioned -- Minerals, water, and other
natural resources.
(1)  To the extent that a trustee accounts for receipts from an interest in
minerals or other natural resources pursuant to this section, the trustee
shall allocate them as follows:
(a)  If received as nominal delay rental or nominal annual rent on a lease, a
receipt must be allocated to income.
(b)  If received from a production payment, a receipt must be allocated to
income if and to the extent that the agreement creating the production payment
provides a factor for interest or its equivalent.  The balance must be
allocated to principal.
(c)  If an amount received as a royalty, shut-in-well payment, take-or-pay
payment, bonus, or delay rental is more than nominal, 90% must be allocated to
principal and the balance to income.
(d)  If an amount is received from a working interest or any other interest
not provided for in Subsection (1)(a), (b), or (c), 90% of the net amount
received must be allocated to principal and the balance to income.
(2)  An amount received on account of an interest in water that is renewable
must be allocated to income.  If the water is not renewable, 90% of the amount
must be allocated to principal and the balance to income.
(3)  This chapter applies whether or not a decedent or donor was extracting
minerals, water, or other natural resources before the interest became subject
to the trust.
(4)  If a trust owns an interest in minerals, water, or other natural
resources on May 3, 2004, the trustee may allocate receipts from the interest
as provided in this chapter or in the manner used by the trustee before May 3,
2004.  If the trust acquires an interest in minerals, water, or other natural
resources after May 3, 2004, the trustee shall allocate receipts from the
interest as provided in this chapter.
