22-3-413.   Receipts normally apportioned -- Property not productive of
income.
(1)  If a marital deduction is allowed for all or part of a trust whose assets
consist substantially of property that does not provide the spouse with
sufficient income from or use of the trust assets, and if the amounts that the
trustee transfers from principal to income under Section 22-3-104 and
distributes to the spouse from principal pursuant to the terms of the trust
are insufficient to provide the spouse with the beneficial enjoyment required
to obtain the marital deduction, the spouse may require the trustee to make
property productive of income, convert property within a reasonable time, or
exercise the power conferred by Subsection 22-3-104(1).  The trustee may
decide which action or combination of actions to take.
(2)  In cases not governed by Subsection (1), proceeds from the sale or other
disposition of an asset are principal without regard to the amount of income
the asset produces during any accounting period.
