(3)  A trustee shall allocate the following receipts from an entity to principal:

(a)  property other than money;

(b)  money received in one distribution or a series of related distributions in exchange for part or all of a trust's interest in the entity;

(c)  money received in total or partial liquidation of the entity; and

(d)  money received from an entity that is a regulated investment company or a real estate investment trust if the money distributed is a capital gain dividend for federal income tax purposes.

(4)  Money is received in partial liquidation:
