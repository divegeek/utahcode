common trust fund, or any other organization in which a trustee has an
interest other than a trust or estate to which Section 22-3-402 applies, a
business or activity to which Section 22-3-403 applies, or an asset-backed
security to which Section 22-3-415 applies.

in exchange for part or all of a trust's interest in the entity;
(c)  money received in total or partial liquidation of the entity; and
(d)  money received from an entity that is a regulated investment company or a
real estate investment trust if the money distributed is a capital gain
dividend for federal income tax purposes.
(4)  Money is received in partial liquidation:

persons authorized to exercise powers to pay money or transfer property
comparable to those of a corporation's board of directors.
