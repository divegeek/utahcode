(3)  change the percentage used to calculate the unitrust amount or the method used to determine the fair market value of the trust if the requirements of Subsections 22-7-103(4)(a) through (f) are completed and the trustee appoints a disinterested person who, in the person's sole discretion but acting in a fiduciary capacity, determines for the trustee:

(a)  the percentage to be used to calculate the unitrust amount;

(b)  the method to be used in determining the fair market value of the trust; and
