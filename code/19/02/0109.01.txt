(3) (a)  Operating permits issued under this section shall be for a period of five years unless the director makes a written finding, after public comment and hearing, and based on substantial evidence in the record, that an operating permit term of less than five years is necessary to protect the public health and the environment of the state.

(b)  The director may issue, modify, or renew an operating permit only after providing public notice, an opportunity for public comment, and an opportunity for a public hearing.

(c)  The director shall, in conformity with the 1990 Clean Air Act and implementing federal regulations, revise the conditions of issued operating permits to incorporate applicable federal regulations in conformity with Section 502(b)(9) of the 1990 Clean Air Act, if the remaining period of the permit is three or more years.

(d)  The director may terminate, modify, revoke, or reissue an operating permit for cause.

(4) (a)  The board shall establish a proposed annual emissions fee that conforms with Title V of the 1990 Clean Air Act for each ton of regulated pollutant, applicable to all sources required to obtain a permit.  The emissions fee established under this section is in addition to fees assessed under Section 19-2-108 for issuance of an approval order.

(b)  In establishing the fee the board shall comply with the provisions of Section 63J-1-504 that require a public hearing and require the established fee to be submitted to the Legislature for its approval as part of the department's annual appropriations request.

(c)  The fee shall cover all reasonable direct and indirect costs required to develop and administer the program and the small business assistance program established under Section 19-2-109.2.

(5)  Emissions fees accrued on and after July 1, 1993, but before issuance of an operating permit, shall be based on the most recent emissions inventory, unless a source elects before July 1, 1992, to base the fee on allowable emissions, if applicable for a regulated pollutant.

(6)  After an operating permit is issued the emissions fee shall be based on actual emissions for a regulated pollutant unless a source elects, prior to the issuance or renewal of a permit, to base the fee during the period of the permit on allowable emissions for that regulated pollutant.

(a)  The owner or operator shall pay the fee under protest prior to being entitled to a hearing.  Payment of an emissions fee or penalty under protest is not a waiver of the right to contest the fee or penalty under this section.
