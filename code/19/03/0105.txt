(4)  Subject to Subsection (8), a new radioactive waste license application, or an application to renew or amend an existing radioactive waste license, is subject to the requirements of Subsections (3)(b) through (d) if the application, renewal, or amendment:

(a)  specifies a different geographic site than a previously submitted application;

(b)  would cost 50% or more of the cost of construction of the original radioactive waste facility or the modification would result in an increase in capacity or throughput of a cumulative total of 50% of the total capacity or throughput which was approved in the facility license as of January 1, 1990, or the initial approval facility license if the initial license approval is subsequent to January 1, 1990; or

(c)  requests approval to receive, transfer, store, decay in storage, treat, or dispose of radioactive waste having a higher radionuclide concentration limit than allowed, under an existing approved license held by the facility, for the specific type of waste to be received, transferred, stored, decayed in storage, treated, or disposed of.

(5)  The requirements of Subsection (4)(c) do not apply to an application to renew or amend an existing radioactive waste license if:

(a)  the radioactive waste facility requesting the renewal or amendment has received a license prior to January 1, 2004; and

(b)  the application to renew or amend its license is limited to a request to approve the receipt, transfer, storage, decay in storage, treatment, or disposal of class A low-level radioactive waste.

(6)  A radioactive waste facility which receives a new radioactive waste license after May 3, 2004, is subject to the requirements of Subsections (3)(b) through (d) for any license application, renewal, or amendment that requests approval to receive, transfer, store, decay in storage, treat, or dispose of radioactive waste not previously approved under an existing license held by the facility.

(7)  If the board finds that approval of additional radioactive waste license applications, renewals, or amendments will result in inadequate oversight, monitoring, or licensure compliance and enforcement of existing and any additional radioactive waste facilities, the board shall suspend acceptance of further applications for radioactive waste licenses.  The board shall report the suspension to the Legislative Management Committee.

(8)  The requirements of Subsections (3)(c) and (d) and Subsection 19-3-104(11) do not apply to:
