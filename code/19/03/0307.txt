(iv)  areas 200 feet from Holocene faults;

(v)  underground mines, salt domes, or salt beds;

(vi)  dam failure flood areas;

(vii)  areas subject to landslide, mud flow, or other earth movement, unless adverse impacts can be mitigated;

(xiii)  drinking water source protection areas;

(b)  in areas:

(i)  above or underlain by aquifers that:

(A)  contain groundwater which has a total dissolved solids content of less than 500 mg/l; and

(B)  do not exceed state groundwater standards for pollutants;

(ii)  above or underlain by aquifers containing groundwater which has a total dissolved solids content between 3,000 and 10,000 mg/l, when the distance from the surface to the groundwater is less than 100 feet;

(iii)  of extensive withdrawal of water, gas, or oil;

(iv)  above or underlain by weak and unstable soils, including soils that lose their ability to support foundations as a result of hydrocompaction, expansion, or shrinkage;
