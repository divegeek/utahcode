19-3-202.   Practices of party states regarding low-level waste shipments --
Fees for inspections.
(1)  Each party state agrees to adopt practices which will require low-level
waste shipments originating within its borders and destined for a facility
within another party state to conform to the applicable packaging and
transportation requirements and regulations of the host state including:
(a)  maintaining an inventory of all generators within the state that have
shipped or expect to ship low-level waste to facilities in another party
state;
(b)  periodic unannounced inspection of the premises of the generators and the
waste management activities on the premises;
(c)  authorization of the containers in which the waste may be shipped, and a
requirement that generators use only the type of containers authorized by the
state;
(d)  assurance that inspections of the carriers which transport the waste are
conducted by proper authorities, and appropriate enforcement action taken for
violations; and
(e)  after receiving notification from a host state that a generator within
the party state is in violation of applicable packaging or transportation
standards,  taking appropriate action to assure that the violations do not
recur including the inspection of every individual low-level waste shipment by
that generator.
(2)  Each party state may impose fees upon generators and shippers to recover
the cost of the inspections and other practices under this compact.
(3)  Nothing in this section limits any party state's authority to impose
additional or more stringent standards on generators or carriers than those
required under this section.
