19-11-201.   Text of compact.

The Western Interstate Nuclear Compact is hereby enacted into law in the state of Utah and entered into with all other states legally joining therein, in the form substantially as follows:

ARTICLE I.  POLICY AND PURPOSE

The party states recognize that the proper employment of scientific and technological discoveries and advances in nuclear and related fields and direct and collateral application and adaptation of processes and techniques developed in connection therewith, properly correlated with the other resources of the region, can assist substantially in the industrial progress of the West and the further development of the economy of the region.  They also recognize that optimum benefit from nuclear and related scientific or technological resources, facilities and skills requires systematic encouragement, guidance, assistance, and promotion from the party states on a co-operative basis.  It is the policy of the party states to undertake such co-operation on a continuing basis.  It is the purpose of this compact to provide the instruments and framework for such a co-operative effort in nuclear and related fields, to enhance the economy of the West and contribute to the individual and community well-being and the region's people.

ARTICLE II.  THE BOARD

(a)  There is hereby created an agency of the party states to be known as the Western Interstate Nuclear Board.  The board shall be composed of one member from each party state designated or appointed in accordance with the law of the state which the member represents and serving and subject to removal in accordance with such law.  Any member of the board may provide for the discharge of the member's duties and the performance of the member's functions thereon (either for the duration of the member's membership or for any lesser period of time) by a deputy or assistant, if the laws of the member's state make specific provisions therefor.  The federal government may be represented without vote if provision is made by federal law for such representation.

(b)  The board members of the party states shall each be entitled to one vote on the board.  No action of the board shall be binding unless taken at a meeting at which a majority of all members representing the party states are present and unless a majority of the total number of votes on the board are cast in favor thereof.

(c)  The board shall have a seal.

(d)  The board shall elect annually, from among its members, a chairman, a vice-chairman, and treasurer.  The board shall appoint and fix the compensation of an executive director who shall serve at its pleasure and who shall also act as secretary, and who, together with the treasurer, and such other personnel as the board may direct, shall be bonded in such amounts as the board may require.

(e)  The executive director, with the approval of the board, shall appoint and remove or discharge such personnel as may be necessary for the performance of the board's functions irrespective of the civil service, personnel or other merit system laws of any of the party states.

(f)  The board may establish and maintain, independently or in conjunction with any one or more of the party states, or its institutions or subdivisions, a suitable retirement system for its full-time employees.  Employees of the board shall be eligible for social security coverage in respect of old age and survivors insurance provided that the board takes such steps as may be necessary pursuant to federal law to participate in such program of insurance as a governmental agency or unit.  The board may establish and maintain or participate in such additional programs of employee benefits as may be appropriate.

(k)  The board annually shall make to the governor of each party state, a report covering the activities of the board for the preceding year, and embodying such recommendations as may have been adopted by the board, which report shall be transmitted to the legislature of said state.  The board may issue such additional reports as it may deem desirable.

ARTICLE III.  FINANCES

(a)  The board shall submit to the governor or designated officer or officers of each party state a budget of its estimated expenditures for such period as may be required by the laws of that jurisdiction for presentation to the legislature thereof.

(b)  Each of the board's budgets of estimated expenditures shall contain specific recommendations of the amount or amounts to be appropriated by each of the party states.  Each of the board's requests for appropriations pursuant to a budget of estimated expenditures shall be apportioned equally among the party states.  Subject to appropriation by their respective legislatures, the board shall be provided with such funds by each of the party states as are necessary to provide the means of establishing and maintaining facilities, a staff of personnel, and such activities as may be necessary to fulfill the powers and duties imposed upon and entrusted to the board.

(c)  The board may meet any of its obligations in whole or in part with funds available to it under Article II(h) of this compact, provided that the board takes specific action setting aside such funds prior to the incurring of any obligation to be met in whole or in part in this manner.  Except where the board makes use of funds available to it under Article II(h) hereof, the board shall not incur any obligation prior to the allotment of funds by the party jurisdictions adequate to meet the same.
