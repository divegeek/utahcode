(5)  If the executive director determines that the fees established in Subsections (1) and (2) and the environmental assurance fee established in Section 19-6-410.5 are insufficient to maintain the fund on an actuarially sound basis, the executive director may petition the Legislature to increase the petroleum storage tank and underground storage tank installation company permit fees, and the environmental assurance fee to a level that will sustain the fund on an actuarially sound basis.

(6)  The director may waive all or part of the fees required to be paid on or before May 5, 1997, for a petroleum storage tank under this section if no fuel has been dispensed from the tank on or after July 1, 1991.
