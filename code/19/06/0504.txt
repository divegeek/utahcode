19-6-504.   Assurance of sufficient revenue to pay bonds.

(1)  If a public entity issues bonds to finance a solid waste management facility and the bonds mature more than 10 years after the bonded facility begins operation, the public entity owning the facility or the public entity or entities contracting for solid waste management services with the owner of the facility shall assure that a supply of solid waste will be available to the facility in quantities sufficient to generate enough income, together with all other sources of revenue pledged for payment of the bonds, to pay all principal and interest on the bonds during the term of the bonded indebtedness.  The assurance may take the form of:

(a)  long-term contracts, at least equal to the period of the bonded indebtedness, with other public entities or other persons to supply enough solid waste to the facility to retire the bonded indebtedness of the facility; or

(b)  ordinances, franchises, or other forms of regulation requiring that sufficient quantities of solid waste be delivered to the facility for disposal.

(2)  The department shall make rules for periodic reporting by any public entity that establishes ordinances, franchises, or other forms of regulation pursuant to Subsection (1).   The reports shall include information about the quantities of solid waste being received by the facility and whether the charges made for processing the solid waste, together with all other sources of revenue pledged for the payment of principal and interest on the bonds, are sufficient to meet the debt-service on the bonds.
