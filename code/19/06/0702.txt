(a)  a valuable petroleum resource that can be recycled; and

(2)  The Legislature finds used oil should be collected, treated, and reused in a manner that conserves energy and does not present a hazard to public health or the environment.

(3)  The Legislature finds in light of the harmful consequences that can result from the improper disposal and use of used oil, and its value as a resource, the collection, recycling, and reuse of used oil is in the public interest.
