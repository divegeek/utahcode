19-6-108.   New nonhazardous solid or hazardous waste operation plans for facility or site -- Administrative and legislative approval required -- Exemptions from legislative and gubernatorial approval -- Time periods for review -- Information required -- Other conditions -- Revocation of approval -- Periodic review.

(1)  For purposes of this section, the following items shall be treated as submission of a new operation plan:

(a)  the submission of a revised operation plan specifying a different geographic site than a previously submitted plan;

(b)  an application for modification of a commercial hazardous waste incinerator if the construction or the modification would increase the hazardous waste incinerator capacity above the capacity specified in the operation plan as of January 1, 1990, or the capacity specified in the operation plan application as of January 1, 1990, if no operation plan approval has been issued as of January 1, 1990;

(c)  an application for modification of a commercial nonhazardous solid waste incinerator if the construction of the modification would cost 50% or more of the cost of construction of the original incinerator or the modification would result in an increase in the capacity or throughput of the incinerator of a cumulative total of 50% above the total capacity or throughput that was approved in the operation plan as of January 1, 1990, or the initial approved operation plan if the initial approval is subsequent to January 1, 1990;

(d)  an application for modification of a commercial nonhazardous solid or hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facility, other than an incinerator, if the modification would be outside the boundaries of the property owned or controlled by the applicant, as shown in the application or approved operation plan as of January 1, 1990, or the initial approved operation plan if the initial approval is subsequent to January 1, 1990; or

(e)  a submission of an operation plan to construct a facility, if previous approvals of the operation plan to construct the facility have been revoked pursuant to Subsection (3)(c)(iii).

(2)  Capacity under Subsection (1)(b) shall be calculated based on the throughput tonnage specified for the trial burn in the operation plan or the operation plan application if no operation plan approval has been issued as of January 1, 1990, and on annual operations of 7,000 hours.

(3) (a) (i)  No person may own, construct, modify, or operate any facility or site for the purpose of disposing of nonhazardous solid waste or treating, storing, or disposing of hazardous waste without first submitting and receiving the approval of the director for an operation plan for that facility or site.

(ii) (A)  A permittee who is the current owner of a facility or site that is subject to an operation plan may submit to the director information, a report, a plan, or other request for approval for a proposed activity under an operation plan:

(I)  after obtaining the consent of any other permittee who is a current owner of the facility or site; and

(II)  without obtaining the consent of any other permittee who is not a current owner of the facility or site.

(B)  The director may not:

(I)  withhold an approval of an operation plan requested by a permittee who is a current owner of the facility or site on the grounds that another permittee who is not a current owner of the facility or site has not consented to the request; or

(II)  give an approval of an operation plan requested by a permittee who is not a current owner before receiving consent of the current owner of the facility or site.

(b) (i)  Except for facilities that receive the following wastes solely for the purpose of recycling, reuse, or reprocessing, no person may own, construct, modify, or operate any commercial facility that accepts for treatment or disposal, with the intent to make a profit, any of the wastes listed in Subsection (3)(b)(ii) without first submitting a request to and receiving the approval of the director for an operation plan for that facility site.

(ii)  Wastes referred to in Subsection (3)(b)(i) are:

(A)  fly ash waste, bottom ash waste, slag waste, or flue gas emission control waste generated primarily from the combustion of coal or other fossil fuels;

(B)  wastes from the extraction, beneficiation, and processing of ores and minerals; or

(C)  cement kiln dust wastes.

(c) (i)  No person may construct a facility listed under Subsection (3)(c)(ii) until the person receives:
