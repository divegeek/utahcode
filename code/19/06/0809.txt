(II)  a contract exists for the sale of the chipped tire; or
(E)  a use defined in rule as recycling.
(b)  A recycler is not eligible to receive partial reimbursement for

product if:

and
(ii)  the recycler, or another recycler, previously received under this

derived from waste tires recycled, other than as crumb rubber; and
