19-6-204.   Guidelines for facility siting -- Considerations in adopting.

(1)  The board shall adopt and publish guidelines for the location of hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities.  The guidelines shall ensure that facilities are sited so that the wastes located there will not constitute an unacceptable health hazard or impact the environment in an unacceptable manner.

(2)  Proposed guidelines for siting shall take into account the following considerations:

(a)  the zoning classification of the site proposed and its proximity to present or projected land use dedicated to industrial development;

(b)  the existing land uses and the density of population in areas neighboring the proposed site;

(c)  the density of population in areas adjacent to probable hazardous waste delivery routes;

(d)  the risk and impact of accidents which might occur during the transportation of hazardous wastes to the site;

(e)  the determination of areas that are dedicated to an incompatible public use or are unsuitable for other reasons for the location of hazardous wastes;

(f)  the geology of the proposed site with special attention to the presence of fault zones and the risk of contamination to ground and surface waters through leaching and runoff;

(g)  the risk to life and property from fires or explosions that might occur if improper storage and disposal methods are used;

(h)  the economic and environmental impact of the proposed facility site location upon local governmental units adjacent to, or within which, the facility is proposed for location;

(i)  closure and postclosure monitoring and maintenance requirements; and

(j)  other criteria required for the siting of hazardous wastes under state or federal law.
