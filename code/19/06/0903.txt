(c)  The report under Subsection (1)(a) shall include:

(i)  the date of the observation;

(ii)  the name of the reporting agency and the case number of the case that involves the location of the observation;

(4)  The local health departments shall maintain searchable records of the properties on their contamination lists and shall:

(a)  make the records reasonably available to the public;

(b)  provide written notification to persons requesting access to the records that the records are only advisory in determining if specific property has been contaminated by clandestine drug lab activity; and

(c)  remove the contaminated property from the list when the following conditions have been met:

(i)  the local health department has monitored the decontamination process and, after documenting that the test results meet decontamination standards, has authorized the removal of or purging of the contamination information from the department's records; or

(ii)  a certified decontamination specialist submits a report to the local health department stating that the property is decontaminated.
