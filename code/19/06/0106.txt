In making the rules, the board may incorporate by reference corresponding federal regulations.

(2)  The board may make rules more stringent than corresponding federal regulations for the purposes described in Subsection (1), only if it makes a written finding after public comment and hearing and based on evidence in the record that corresponding federal regulations are not adequate to protect public health and the environment of the state.  Those findings shall be accompanied by an opinion referring to and evaluating the public health and environmental information and studies contained in the record which form the basis for the conclusion.
