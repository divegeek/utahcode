(2) (a)  In any apportionment of liability, whether made by the director or made in any administrative proceeding or judicial action, the following standards apply:

(i)  liability shall be apportioned among responsible parties in proportion to their respective contributions to the release; and

(ii)  the apportionment of liability shall be based on equitable factors, including the quantity, mobility, persistence, and toxicity of regulated substances contributed by a responsible party, and the comparative behavior of a responsible party in contributing to the release, relative to other responsible parties.

(b) (i)  The burden of proving proportionate contribution shall be borne by each responsible party.

(ii)  If a responsible party does not prove the responsible party's proportionate contribution, the court or the director shall apportion liability to the party based on available evidence and the standards of Subsection (2)(a).

(c)  The court, the board, or the director may not impose joint and several liability.

(d)  Each responsible party is strictly liable for his share of costs.

(3)  The failure of the director to name all responsible parties is not a defense to an action under this section.

(4)  The director may enter into an agreement with any responsible party regarding that party's proportionate share of liability or any action to be taken by that party.

(5)  The director and a responsible party may not enter into an agreement under this part unless all responsible parties named and identified under Subsection 19-6-420(1)(a):

(7) (a)  A party who has resolved his liability under this part is not liable for claims for contribution regarding matters addressed in the agreement or order.

(c)  A party who resolved his liability for some or all of the costs under this part may seek contribution from any person who is not a party to the agreement or order.
