(i)  liability shall be apportioned among responsible parties in proportion to their respective contributions to the release; and

(b) (i)  The burden of proving proportionate contribution shall be borne by each responsible party.

(ii)  If a responsible party does not prove the responsible party's proportionate contribution, the court or the director shall apportion liability to the party based on available evidence and the standards of Subsection (2)(a).

(c)  The court, the board, or the director may not impose joint and several liability.

(d)  Each responsible party is strictly liable for his share of costs.
