19-5-116.   Limitation on effluent limitation standards for BOD, SS,
Coliforms, and pH for domestic or municipal sewage.
Unless required to meet instream water quality standards or federal
requirements established under the federal Water Pollution Control Act, the
board shall not establish, under Section  19-5-104, effluent limitation
standards for Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Total Suspended Solids (SS),
Coliforms, and pH for domestic or municipal sewage which are more stringent
than the following:
(1)  Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD): The arithmetic mean of BOD values
determined on effluent samples collected during any 30-day period shall not
exceed 25 mg/l, nor shall the arithmetic mean exceed 35 mg/l during any seven-
day period.
(2)  Total Suspended Solids (SS): The arithmetic mean of SS values determined
on effluent samples collected during any 30-day period shall not exceed 25
mg/l, nor shall the arithmetic mean exceed 35 mg/l during any seven-day
period.
(3)  Coliform: The geometric mean of total coliforms and fecal coliform
bacteria in effluent samples collected during any 30-day period shall not
exceed either 2000/100 ml for total coliforms or 200/100 ml for fecal
coliforms. The geometric mean during any seven-day period shall not exceed
2500/100 ml for total coliforms or 250/100 for fecal coliforms.
(4)  pH: The pH level shall be maintained at a level not less than 6.5 or
greater than 9.0.
