(2)  "Amount of kilowatt-hours attributable to electricity generated or
purchased in that calendar year from qualifying carbon sequestration
generation," for qualifying carbon sequestration generation, means the
kilowatt-hours supplied by a facility during the calendar year multiplied by
the ratio of the amount of carbon dioxide captured from the facility and
sequestered to the sum of the amount of carbon dioxide captured from the
facility and sequestered plus the amount of carbon dioxide emitted from the
facility during the same calendar year.

(b)  carried forward into a subsequent year.
(4)  "Bundled renewable energy certificate" means a renewable energy
certificate for qualifying electricity that is acquired:

(b)  by a municipal electric utility by generating the electricity for which
the renewable energy certificate is issued.
(5)  "Commission" means the Public Service Commission.

controls, or manages a facility that provides electric power for a retail
customer, whether domestic, commercial, industrial, or otherwise.
(7)  "Qualifying carbon sequestration generation" means a fossil-fueled
generating facility located within the geographic boundary of the Western
Electricity Coordinating Council that:
(a)  becomes operational or is retrofitted on or after January 1, 2008; and
(b)  reduces carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere through permanent
geological sequestration or through other verifiably permanent reductions in
carbon dioxide emissions through the use of technology.
(8)  "Qualifying electricity" means electricity generated on or after January
1, 1995 from a renewable energy source if:
(a) (i)  the renewable energy source is located within the geographic boundary
of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council; or
(ii)  the qualifying electricity is delivered to the transmission system of a
municipal electric utility or a delivery point designated by the municipal
electric utility for the purpose of subsequent delivery to the municipal
electric utility; and
(b)  the renewable energy attributes of the electricity are not traded, sold,
transferred, or otherwise used to satisfy another state's renewable energy
program.
(9)  "Qualifying zero carbon emissions generation":
(a)  means a generation facility located within the geographic boundary of the
Western Electricity Coordinating Council that:
(i)  becomes operational on or after January 1, 2008; and
(ii)  does not produce carbon as a byproduct of the generation process;
(b)  includes generation powered by nuclear fuel; and
(c)  does not include renewable energy sources used to satisfy a target
established under Section 10-19-201.
(10)  "Renewable energy certificate" means a certificate issued in accordance
with the requirements of Sections 10-19-202 and 54-17-603.
(11)  "Renewable energy source" means:
(a)  an electric generation facility or generation capability or upgrade that

one or more of the following:
(i)  wind energy;
(ii)  solar photovoltaic and solar thermal energy;
(iii)  wave, tidal, and ocean thermal energy;
(iv)  except for combustion of wood that has been treated with chemical
preservatives such as creosote, pentachlorophenol or chromated copper
arsenate, biomass and biomass byproducts, including:
(A)  organic waste;
(B)  forest or rangeland woody debris from harvesting or thinning conducted to
improve forest or rangeland ecological health and to reduce wildfire risk;
(C)  agricultural residues;
(D)  dedicated energy crops; and

anaerobic digesters, or municipal solid waste;
(v)  geothermal energy located outside the state;
