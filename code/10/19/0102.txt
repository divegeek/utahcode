(7)  "Qualifying carbon sequestration generation" means a fossil-fueled generating facility located within the geographic boundary of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council that:

(a)  becomes operational or is retrofitted on or after January 1, 2008; and

(b)  reduces carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere through permanent geological sequestration or through other verifiably permanent reductions in carbon dioxide emissions through the use of technology.

(8)  "Qualifying electricity" means electricity generated on or after January 1, 1995 from a renewable energy source if:

(a) (i)  the renewable energy source is located within the geographic boundary of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council; or

(ii)  the qualifying electricity is delivered to the transmission system of a municipal electric utility or a delivery point designated by the municipal electric utility for the purpose of subsequent delivery to the municipal electric utility; and

(b)  the renewable energy attributes of the electricity are not traded, sold, transferred, or otherwise used to satisfy another state's renewable energy program.

(9)  "Qualifying zero carbon emissions generation":

(a)  means a generation facility located within the geographic boundary of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council that:

(i)  becomes operational on or after January 1, 2008; and

(ii)  does not produce carbon as a byproduct of the generation process;

(b)  includes generation powered by nuclear fuel; and

(c)  does not include renewable energy sources used to satisfy a target established under Section 10-19-201.

(10)  "Renewable energy certificate" means a certificate issued in accordance with the requirements of Sections 10-19-202 and 54-17-603.

(11)  "Renewable energy source" means:

(a)  an electric generation facility or generation capability or upgrade that becomes operational on or after January 1, 1995 that derives its energy from one or more of the following:

(i)  wind energy;

(ii)  solar photovoltaic and solar thermal energy;

(iii)  wave, tidal, and ocean thermal energy;

(iv)  except for combustion of wood that has been treated with chemical preservatives such as creosote, pentachlorophenol or chromated copper arsenate, biomass and biomass byproducts, including:

(B)  a coal degassing operation associated with a state-approved mine permit;

(vii)  efficiency upgrades to a hydroelectric facility, without regard to the date upon which the facility became operational, if the upgrades become operational on or after January 1, 1995;

(viii)  a compressed air energy storage process, if:
