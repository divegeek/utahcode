10-5-119.   Special fund balance -- Disposition when fund no longer
required.
Whenever the necessity for maintaining any special fund of a town has ceased
to exist and a balance remains in the fund, the governing body shall authorize
the transfer of the balance to the fund balance account in the general fund of
the town, subject to the following:
(1)  Any balance remaining in a special assessment fund and any unrequired
balance in its special improvements guaranty fund shall be treated in the
manner provided in Sections 11-42-413 and 11-42-701;
(2)  Any balance remaining in a capital improvements or capital projects fund
shall be transferred to the appropriate debt service fund or other fund as the
bond ordinance may require and otherwise to the fund balance account in the
general fund;
(3)  Whenever any balance held in a trust fund for a specific purpose, other
than a cemetery perpetual care trust fund, is to be transferred because its
original purpose or restriction has ceased to exist, a public hearing shall be
held in the manner provided in Sections 10-5-108 and 10-5-109.  The published
notice shall invite those persons who contributed to the fund to appear at the
hearing.  If the council determines the fund balance amounts are refundable to
the original contributors, a 30-day period following the hearing shall be
allowed for persons having an interest in the fund to file with the council a
verified claim only for the amount of each claimant's contributions.  Any
claim not filed in accordance with this section shall be invalid.  Any balance
remaining, after refunds to eligible contributors, shall be transferred to the
fund balance account in the general fund of the town; and
(4)  Whenever the council decides, in conformity with applicable laws and
ordinances, that the need for continued maintenance of its cemetery perpetual
care trust fund no longer exists, it may transfer the balance in such fund to
the capital improvements fund for expenditure for land, buildings, and major
improvements to be used exclusively for cemetery purposes.
