(1)  Notwithstanding Sections 10-9a-603 and 10-9a-604, the land use authority may approve a subdivision of 10 lots or less without a plat, by certifying in writing that:

(2) (a)  Subject to Subsection (1), a lot or parcel resulting from a division of agricultural land is exempt from the plat requirements of Section 10-9a-603 if the lot or parcel:

(iii)  is not used and will not be used for any nonagricultural purpose.

(3) (a)  Documents recorded in the county recorder's office that divide property by a metes and bounds description do not create an approved subdivision allowed by this part unless the land use authority's certificate of written approval required by Subsection (1) is attached to the document.

(b)  The absence of the certificate or written approval required by Subsection (1) does not:

(i)  prohibit the county recorder from recording a document; or

(ii)  affect the validity of a recorded document.

(c)  A document which does not meet the requirements of Subsection (1) may be corrected by the recording of an affidavit to which the required certificate or written approval is attached in accordance with Section 57-3-106.
