(1)  If the governing body of a city determines that an emergency exists, such as widespread damage from fire, flood, or earthquake, and that the emergency necessitates the expenditure of money in excess of the budget of the general fund, the governing body may by resolution amend the budget and authorize such expenditures and incur such deficits in the fund balance of the general fund as may be reasonably necessary to meet the emergency.

(2)  Except to the extent provided for in Title 53, Chapter 2, Part 4, Disaster Recovery Funding Act, the governing body of a city may not expend money in the city's local fund for an emergency, if the city creates a local fund under Title 53, Chapter 2, Part 4, Disaster Recovery Funding Act.
