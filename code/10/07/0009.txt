provided, that no such bonds shall be sold for less than their face value. The
board of commissioners, city council or board of trustees shall annually levy
on all taxable property within the boundaries of the issuer a sufficient tax
to pay the interest on such indebtedness as it falls due, and also to
constitute a sinking fund for the payment of the principal thereof within the
time for which such bonds are issued which levy shall be made without regard
to any statutory limitation on the taxing power of such issuer which may now
exist or, unless an express contrary provision appears in the statute, which
may hereafter be enacted by the legislature; provided, that whenever bonds
shall have been issued for the purpose of supplying any city or town with
artificial light, water or other public utility the rates or charges for the
service of the system or plant so constructed may be made sufficient to meet
such payments, in addition to operating and maintenance expenses, and taxes
shall be levied to meet any deficiencies. Water or sewer bonds may be issued
for a period not exceeding forty years; other bonds may be issued for a period
not exceeding twenty years. Such bonds may be either serial or term bonds.
