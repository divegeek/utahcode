10-7-27.   Street railway companies to restore streets.

Every street railway company shall at its own expense restore the pavement, including the foundation thereof, of every street disturbed by it in the construction, reconstruction, removal or repair of its tracks, to the same condition as before the disturbance thereof, to the satisfaction of the governing body having charge of such street. The obligation imposed hereby shall, in cities other than cities of the first class, be in lieu and substitution of any and all other obligations of any such company to pave, repave or repair any street, or to pay any part of the cost thereof, and may be enforced in the same manner as similar obligations are or may be enforced under the laws of this state. Nothing herein contained shall be considered to relieve any such company from the repayment of any money which has heretofore been advanced or expended by any city for any paving heretofore done under or by virtue of a specific contract or agreement made and entered into between the board of commissioners or the city council of any city and such company providing for the repayment thereof, but the obligation for such repayment shall be and remain enforceable as if this section had not been passed.
