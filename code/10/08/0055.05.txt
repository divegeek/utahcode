(1)  A municipality, or a person who contracts with a municipality to provide emergency services:

(a)  may not impose a flat fee, or collect a flat fee, from an individual involved in a traffic incident; and

(b)  may only charge the individual for the actual cost of services provided in responding to the traffic incident, limited to:

(i)  medical costs for:

(A)  transporting an individual from the scene of a traffic accident; or

(B)  treatment of a person injured in a traffic accident;

(ii)  repair to damaged public property, if the individual is legally liable for the damage;

(iii)  the cost of materials used in cleaning up the traffic accident, if the individual is legally liable for the traffic accident; and
