10-2-701.   Petition for disincorporation -- Validity -- District court
order for election.
Disincorporation of a municipality shall be initiated upon petition.  The
petition shall bear signatures equal in number to 25% of all votes cast from
the municipality at the last congressional election. No signature is valid,
for purposes of this section, unless it is that of a registered voter who is a
resident of the municipality proposed for disincorporation.
The petition containing the specified number of signatures shall be filed with
the county clerk for validation by that officer. If the county clerk finds the
petition valid, the clerk shall file the original with the district court and
furnish a copy to the governing body of the municipality.
The district court, upon determining that the petition comports with Section
10-2-701.5 and that it does not offend Section 10-2-710 and is otherwise
complete, shall order that the question of dissolution be placed before the
voters of the municipality.
