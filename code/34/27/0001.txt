Whenever a mechanic, artisan, miner, laborer, servant, or other employee shall
have cause to bring suit for wages earned and due according to the terms of
his employment and shall establish by the decision of the court that the
amount for which he has brought suit is justly due, and that a demand has been
made in writing at least 15 days before suit was brought for a sum not to
exceed the amount so found due, then it shall be the duty of the court before
which the case shall be tried to allow to the plaintiff a reasonable

costs of suit.
