34-19-8.   Injunctive relief -- Appeals.

Whenever any court, or judge or judges of it, shall issue or deny any temporary injunction in a case involving or growing out of a labor dispute, the court shall, upon the request of any party to the proceedings, and on his filing the usual bond for costs, forthwith certify the entire record of the case, including a transcript of the evidence taken, to the appropriate appellate court for its review. Upon the filing of such record in the appropriate appellate court the appeal shall be heard with the greatest possible expedition, giving the proceeding precedence over all other matters except older matters of the same character.
