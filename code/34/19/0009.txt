34-19-9.   Injunctive relief -- Contempt -- Rights of accused.
In all cases where a person shall be charged with indirect criminal contempt
for violation of a restraining order or injunction issued by a court, or judge
or judges of it, the accused shall enjoy:
(1)  the rights as to admission to bail that are accorded to persons accused
of crime;
(2)  the right to be notified of the accusation and a reasonable time to make
a defense, provided the alleged contempt is not committed in the immediate
view of or in the presence of the court;
(3)  upon demand, the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury
of the judicial district in which the contempt shall have been committed. This
requirement shall not be construed to apply to contempts committed in the
presence of the court or so near to it as to interfere directly with the
administration of justice or to apply to the misbehavior, misconduct, or
disobedience of any officer of the court in respect to the writs, orders or
process of the court; and
(4)  the right to file with the court a demand for the retirement of the judge
sitting in the proceeding, if the contempt arises from an attack upon the
character or conduct of such judge and if the attack occurred otherwise than
in open court. Upon the filing of any such demand the judge shall proceed no
further, but another judge shall be designated by the presiding judge of the
court. The demand shall be filed prior to the hearing in the contempt
proceeding.
