(3)  Whenever the division shall require the sheriff, constable, or other officer whose duty it is to seize property or levy thereon in any attachment proceedings to satisfy any wage claim judgment to perform any such duty, this officer shall do so without requiring the division to furnish any security or bond in the action.

(4)  The officer in carrying out the provisions of this Subsection (4) is not responsible in damages for any wrongful seizure made in good faith.

Out of any recovery on a judgment in such a suit, there shall be paid the following: first, the witness fees to the garnishee defendant; second, the wage claims involved; third, the sheriff's or constable's fees; and fourth, the court costs.
