(3)  Each state agency shall:

(a)  designate a staff member that is responsible for coordinating energy efficiency efforts within the agency;

(b)  provide energy consumption and costs information to the division;

(c)  develop strategies for improving energy efficiency and reducing energy costs; and

(d)  provide the division with information regarding the agency's energy efficiency and reduction strategies.

(4) (a)  A state agency may enter into an energy savings agreement for a term of up to 20 years.

(b)  Before entering into an energy savings agreement, the state agency shall:

(i)  utilize the division to oversee the project unless the project is exempt from the division's oversight or the oversight is delegated to the agency under the provisions of Section 63A-5-206;
