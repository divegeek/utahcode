of the Courts -- Director's responsibilities.
(1)  Before executing any high-cost lease or a modification to a lease that
results in a high-cost lease, the Administrative Office of the Courts shall
submit a draft of the new lease or modification to:
(a)  the Judicial Council; and
(b)  the director of the Division of Facilities Construction and Management.
(2)  The director shall:

and
(b)  within 30 days after receiving the drafts from the office, submit a
report on those drafts to:
(i)  the Judicial Council; and
(ii)  the Office of Legislative Fiscal Analyst.
(3)  The report shall contain:
(a)  the director's opinion about:
(i)  whether or not the lease or modification is cost-effective when the needs
of the entity to be housed in the leased facility are considered;
(ii)  whether or not another option such as construction, use of other state-
owned space, or a lease-purchase agreement is more cost-effective than
leasing; and
(iii)  whether or not the significant lease terms are cost-effective and
provide the state with sufficient flexibility and protection from liability;
(b)  a comparison of the proposed lease payments to the current market rates,
and a recommendation as to whether or not the proposed lease payments are
reasonable under current market conditions;
(c)  a comparison of proposed significant lease terms to the current market,
and a recommendation as to whether these proposed terms are reasonable under
current market conditions; and
(d)  a recommendation from the director that the lease or modification to a
lease be approved or disapproved.
(4) (a)  The Administrative Office of the Courts may not execute any new high-
cost leases or modifications to any existing lease that will result in a high-
cost lease unless that lease or those modifications are approved by a majority
vote of the Judicial Council.
(b)  The Judicial Council shall consider the recommendations of the director
of the division  in determining whether or not to approve high-cost leases and
modifications resulting in high-cost leases.
