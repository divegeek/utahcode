63B-1-302.   Legislative findings.
The Legislature finds and declares as follows:
(1)  it is the policy of this state to provide office space and related
facilities for state bodies and such other governmental facilities and
property, including highways and highway rights-of-way, as may be necessary or
desirable, in the most efficient and economical way possible;
(2)  many state bodies are inadequately provided with necessary office space,
related facilities, other governmental facilities, and property to serve the
public welfare;
(3)  the state is renting space for state bodies in privately owned buildings
with funds which could more efficiently and economically be put to use toward
the purchase and acquisition of  facilities by the state;
(4)  in order to provide for a fully adequate supply of office space, related
facilities, other governmental facilities, and property at the lowest possible
cost, this Legislature should establish a State Building Ownership Authority
for the purpose of financing, owning, leasing, operating, or encumbering such
facilities to meet the needs of the state government and to serve the public
welfare;
(5)  the foregoing involve public purposes and uses for which public moneys
may be borrowed, expended, advanced, loaned, or granted, the activities
specified would serve a public purpose in improving or otherwise benefiting
the people of this state and, therefore, this part is in the public interest
and is declared to be in the public interest as a matter of express
legislative determination; and
(6)  the compelling need within this state for the creation of an adequate
supply of office space, related facilities, other government facilities, and
property for state bodies at a low cost can be best met by the establishment
of a body corporate and politic vested with the powers and duties specified in
this part.
