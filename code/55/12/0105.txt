(h)  establishing standards and procedures for compliance and technical assistance in carrying out the compact.

(2)  Section B.  Officers and Staff

(a)  The Interstate Commission shall, by a majority of the members, elect annually from among its members a chairperson and a vice chairperson, each of whom shall have the authority and duties specified in the by-laws.  The chairperson or, in the chairperson's absence or disability, the vice chairperson shall preside at all meetings of the commission.

(c)  The commission shall, through its executive committee, appoint or retain an executive director for any time period, upon any terms and conditions, and for any compensation as the commission may consider appropriate.  The executive director shall serve as secretary to the commission, but may not be a member and shall hire and supervise other staff as authorized by the commission.

(3)  Section C.  Qualified Immunity, Defense, and Indemnification

(a)  The Interstate Commission's executive director and employees shall be immune from suit and liability, either personally or in their official capacity, for any claim for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or other civil liability caused or arising out of or relating to any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred, or that the person had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided, that a person may not be protected from suit or liability for any damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of the person.

(b)  The liability of any commissioner, or the employee or agent of a commissioner, acting within the scope of the person's employment or duties for acts, errors, or omissions occurring within the person's state may not exceed the limits of liability set forth under the constitution and laws of that state for state officials, employees, and agents.  Nothing in this Subsection (3) shall be construed to protect any person from suit or liability for any damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of the person.

(c)  The commission shall defend the executive director or the employees or representatives of the commission and, subject to the approval of the attorney general of the state represented by any commissioner of a compacting state, shall defend the commissioner or the commissioner's representatives or employees in any civil action seeking to impose liability arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that the defendant had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from intentional or willful and wanton misconduct on the part of the person.

(d)  The commission shall indemnify and hold the commissioner of a compacting state,  the commissioner's representatives or employees, or the commission's representatives or employees harmless in the amount of any settlement or judgment obtained against the persons arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that the persons had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from intentional or willful and wanton misconduct on the part of the persons.
