record that the person believes should be protected under a provision listed
in Subsection 63G-2-309(1)(b)(i), restricted under Section 53B-16-302, or both
protected under a provision listed in Subsection 63G-2-309(1)(b)(i) and
restricted under Section 53B-16-302, shall provide the public institution of
higher education:
(i)  a written claim of business confidentiality; and
(ii)  a concise statement of reasons supporting the claim of business
confidentiality.
(b)  The person described in Subsection (1)(a) shall make the filing at the
commencement of:

confidentiality at the time required by Subsection (1) does not prejudice the
claimant's right to make a legally adequate claim at a different time before
disclosure of the record.
