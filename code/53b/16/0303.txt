Notwithstanding any other provision of Title 63G, Chapter 2, Government
Records Access and Management Act, access to records restricted by this part
shall only be permitted upon:
(1)  written consent of the public institution of higher education
originating, receiving, or maintaining such records; or
(2)  a finding by the State Records Committee or a court that the record has
not been properly classified as restricted under Section 63G-2-302, provided
that the review of a restricted classification of a record shall not include
considerations of weighing public and private interests regarding access to a
properly classified record as contained in Subsection 63G-2-403(11)(b) or
63G-2-404(8) or Section 63G-2-309. Nothing in this Subsection (2) shall be
