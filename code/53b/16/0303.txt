(2)  a finding by the State Records Committee or a court that the record has not been properly classified as restricted under Section 63G-2-302, provided that the review of a restricted classification of a record shall not include considerations of weighing public and private interests regarding access to a properly classified record as contained in Subsection 63G-2-403(11)(b) or 63G-2-404(8) or Section 63G-2-309.
