additional programs for higher education funding and that the continued
operation and maintenance of the state's public institutions of higher
education and the general welfare of the citizens of the state will be
enhanced by establishing a plan which allows citizens of the state to invest
money in a public trust for future application to the payment of higher
education costs.

(2)(a) serves a vital and valid public purpose.

opportunity to fund future higher education needs, it is necessary that a
public trust be established in which money may be invested for future
educational use.

may be funded with public funds, among other sources, the income from which
may be made available to account owners to enhance or encourage their savings
invested for future higher education costs or for use in scholarship or other
college savings incentive programs.
