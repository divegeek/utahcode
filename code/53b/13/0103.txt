The board has the powers necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter, including the following:

(3)  to acquire, purchase, or make commitments to purchase, and take assignments from lenders of obligations.  No obligation is eligible for acquisition, purchase, or commitment to purchase by the board unless at or before the time of transfer to the board the lender certifies either: (a) that, under and to the extent required by rules and regulations of the board, the proceeds of sale or its equivalent shall be reinvested in other obligations under the student loan program; or (b) that the obligation was made in anticipation of its sale to the board under rules and regulations of the board promulgated under this chapter;

The state is not liable for the repayment of bonds issued by the board.  The bonds issued by the board are not a debt of the state, and each bond shall contain on its face a statement to this effect;

(8)  to invest funds not required for immediate use or disbursement as provided in the State Money Management Act;

(9)  subject to a contract with the holders of its bonds, an applicable bond resolution, or a contract with the recipient of a loan, to consent to the modification, with respect to security, rate of interest, time of payment of interest or principal, or other term of a bond contract or agreement between the board and a recipient of a loan, bondholder, or agency or institution guaranteeing the repayment of an obligation;

(14)  to sell obligations held by the board at such prices and at such times as it may determine, when that sale would not impair the rights or interests of holders of bonds issued by the board; and
