(2) (a)  The State Board of Regents shall award the incentive loans to college students who have been admitted to, or have made application to and are prepared to enter into, a program preparing students for licensure and who declare an intent to complete the prescribed course of instruction and to teach in this state in accordance with the priorities described under Subsection (5)(c).

(b)  The incentive loan may be canceled at any time by the institution of attendance if:

(4) (a)  The State Board of Regents may require an incentive loan recipient who does not work in the state's public school system or a private school within the state within two years after graduation to repay all tuition and fees provided by the loan, together with appropriate interest, unless waived for good cause.

(b) (i)  A recipient who does not teach for a term equal to the number of years of the incentive loan within a reasonable period of time after graduation shall repay a graduated portion of the tuition and fees based upon the uncompleted term.

(ii)  One year of teaching is credit for one year's tuition and fees.

(c)  All repayments made under this Subsection (4) are for use in the Terrel H. Bell Teaching Incentive Loans program.
