40-10-17.   Performance standards for all coal mining and reclamation
operations -- Additional standards for steep-slope surface coal mining --
Variances.
(1)  Any permit issued pursuant to this chapter to conduct surface coal mining
shall require that the surface coal mining operations will meet all applicable
performance standards of this chapter, and such other requirements as the
division shall promulgate.
(2)  General performance standards shall be applicable to all surface coal
mining and reclamation operations and shall require the operations as a
minimum to:
(a)  Conduct surface coal mining operations so as to maximize the utilization
and conservation of the solid fuel resource being recovered so that
reaffecting the land in the future through surface coal mining can be
minimized.
(b)  Restore the land affected to a condition capable of supporting the uses
which it was capable of supporting prior to any mining, or higher or better
uses of which there is reasonable likelihood, so long as the use or uses does
not present any actual or probable hazard to public health or safety or pose
any actual or probable threat of water diminution or pollution, and the permit
applicant's declared proposed land use following reclamation is not considered
to be impractical or unreasonable, inconsistent with applicable land use
policies and plans, involves unreasonable delay in implementation, or is
violative of federal, state, or local law.
(c)  Except as provided in Subsection (3) with respect to all surface coal
mining operations backfill, compact (where advisable to insure stability or to
prevent leaching of toxic materials) and grade in order to restore the
approximate original contour of the land with highwalls, spoil piles, and
depressions eliminated (unless small depressions are needed in order to retain
moisture to assist revegetation or as otherwise authorized pursuant to this
chapter); but in surface coal mining which is carried out at the same location
over a substantial period of time where the operation transects the coal
deposit and the thickness of the coal deposits relative to the volume of the
overburden is large and where the operator demonstrates that the overburden
and other spoil and waste materials at a particular point in the permit area
or otherwise available from the entire permit area is insufficient, giving due
consideration to volumetric expansion, to restore the approximate original
contour, the operator, at a minimum, shall backfill, grade, and compact (where
advisable) using all available overburden and other spoil and waste materials
to attain the lowest practicable grade but not more than the angle of repose,
to provide adequate drainage and to cover all acid-forming and other toxic
materials, in order to achieve an ecologically sound land use compatible with
the surrounding region.  In surface coal mining where the volume of overburden
is large relative to the thickness of the coal deposit and where the operator
demonstrates that due to volumetric expansion the amount of overburden and
other spoil and waste materials removed in the course of the mining operation
is more than sufficient to restore the approximate original contour, the
operator shall, after restoring the approximate contour, backfill, grade, and
compact (where advisable) the excess overburden and other spoil and waste
materials to attain the lowest grade but more than the angle of repose, and to
cover all acid-forming and other toxic materials, in order to achieve an
ecologically sound land use compatible with the surrounding region and that
the overburden or spoil shall be shaped and graded in such a way as to prevent
slides, erosion, and water pollution and is revegetated in accordance with the
requirements of this chapter.
(d)  Stabilize and protect all surface areas, including spoil piles affected
by the surface coal mining and reclamation operation to effectively control
erosion and attendant air and water pollution.
(e)  Remove the topsoil from the land in a separate layer, replace it on the
backfill area, or if not utilized immediately, segregate it in a separate pile
from other spoil, and when the topsoil is not replaced on a backfill area
within a time short enough to avoid deterioration of the topsoil, maintain a
successful cover by quick growing plant or other means thereafter so that the
topsoil is preserved from wind and water erosion, remains free of any
contamination by other acid or toxic material, and is in a usable condition
for sustaining vegetation when restored during reclamation; except if topsoil
is of insufficient quantity or of poor quality for sustaining vegetation, or
if other strata can be shown to be more suitable for vegetation requirements,
then the operator shall remove, segregate, and preserve in a like manner the
other strata which is best able to support vegetation.
(f)  Restore the topsoil or the best available subsoil which is best able to
support vegetation.
(g)  For all prime farmlands, as identified in the rules, to be mined and
reclaimed, specifications for soil removal, storage, replacement, and
reconstruction, the operator shall, as a minimum, be required to:
(i)  segregate the A horizon of the natural soil, except where it can be shown
that other available soil materials will create a final soil having a greater
productive capacity, and if not utilized immediately, stockpile this material
separately from other spoil, and provide needed protection from wind and water
erosion or contamination by other acid or toxic material;
(ii)  segregate the B horizon of the natural soil, or underlying C horizons or
other strata, or a combination of these horizons or other strata that are
shown to be both texturally and chemically suitable for plant growth and that
can be shown to be equally or more favorable for plant growth than the B
horizon, in sufficient quantities to create in the regraded final soil a root
zone of comparable depth and quality to that which existed in the natural
soil, and if not utilized immediately, stockpile this material separately from
other spoil, and provide needed protection from wind and water erosion or
contamination by other acid or toxic material;
(iii)  replace and regrade the root zone material described in Subsection
(2)(g)(ii) above with proper compaction and uniform depth over the regraded
spoil material; and
(iv)  redistribute and grade in a uniform manner the surface soil horizon
described in Subsection (2)(g)(i).
(h)  Create, if authorized in the approved mining and reclamation plan and
permit, permanent impoundments of water on mining sites as part of reclamation
activities only when it is adequately demonstrated that:
(i)  the size of the impoundment is adequate for its intended purposes;
(ii)  the impoundment dam construction will be so designed as to achieve
necessary stability with an adequate margin of safety compatible with that of
structures constructed under Public Law 83-566 (16 U.S.C. 1006);
(iii)  the quality of impounded water will be suitable on a permanent basis
for its intended use and that discharges from the impoundment will not degrade
the water quality below water quality standards established pursuant to
applicable federal and state law in the receiving stream;
(iv)  the level of water will be reasonably stable;
(v)  final grading will provide adequate safety and access for proposed water
users; and
(vi)  these water impoundments will not result in the diminution of the
quality or quantity of water utilized by adjacent or surrounding landowners
for agricultural, industrial, recreational, or domestic uses.
(i)  Conducting any augering operation associated with surface mining in a
manner to maximize recoverability of mineral reserves remaining after the
operation and reclamation are complete and seal all auger holes with an
impervious and noncombustible material in order to prevent drainage except
where the division determines that the resulting impoundment of water in the
auger holes may create a hazard to the environment or the public health or
safety; but the permitting authority may prohibit augering if necessary to
maximize the utilization, recoverability, or conservation of the solid fuel
resources or to protect against adverse water quality impacts.
(j)  Minimize the disturbances to the prevailing hydrologic balance at the
mine site and in associated offsite areas and to the quality and quantity of
water in surface and groundwater systems both during and after surface coal
mining operations and during reclamation by:
(i)  avoiding acid or other toxic mine drainage by such measures as, but not
limited to:
(A)  preventing or removing water from contact with toxic-producing deposits;
(B)  treating drainage to reduce toxic content which adversely affects
downstream water upon being released to water courses; and
(C)  casing, sealing, or otherwise managing boreholes, shafts, and wells and
keep acid or other toxic drainage from entering ground and surface waters;
(ii) (A)  conducting surface coal mining operations so as to prevent, to the
extent possible using the best technology currently available, additional
contributions of suspended solids to streamflow or runoff outside the permit
area, but in no event shall contributions be in excess of requirements set by
applicable state or federal law; and
(B)  constructing any siltation structures pursuant to this Subsection
(2)(j)(ii) prior to commencement of surface coal mining operations, such
structures to be certified by a qualified registered engineer to be
constructed as designed and as approved in the reclamation plan;
(iii)  cleaning out and removing temporary or large settling ponds or other
siltation structures from drainways after disturbed areas are revegetated and
stabilized and depositing the silt and debris at a site and in a manner
approved by the division;
(iv)  restoring recharge capacity of the mined area to approximate premining
conditions;
(v)  avoiding channel deepening or enlargement in operations requiring the
discharge of water from mines;
(vi)  preserving throughout the mining and reclamation process the essential
hydrologic functions of alluvial valley floors in the arid and semiarid areas
of the state; and
(vii)  such other actions as the division may prescribe.
(k)  With respect to surface disposal of mine wastes, tailings, coal
processing wastes, and other waste in areas other than the mine working or
excavations, stabilize all waste piles in designated areas through
construction in compacted layers, including the use of incombustible and
impervious materials, if necessary, and assure the final contour of the waste
pile will be compatible with natural surroundings and that the site can and
will be stabilized and revegetated according to the provisions of this
chapter.
(l)  Refrain from surface coal mining within 500 feet from active and
abandoned underground mines in order to prevent breakthroughs and to protect
health or safety of miners; but the division shall permit an operator to mine
near, through, or partially through an abandoned underground mine or closer to
an active underground mine if:
(i)  the nature, timing, and sequencing of the approximate coincidence of
specific surface mine activities with specific underground mine activities are
jointly approved by the departments, divisions, and agencies concerned with
surface mine reclamation and the health and safety of underground miners; and
(ii)  the operations will result in improved resource recovery, abatement of
water pollution, or elimination of hazards to the health and safety of the
public.
(m)  Design, locate, construct, operate, maintain, enlarge, modify, and remove
or abandon, in accordance with the standards and criteria developed pursuant
to the division's rules, all existing and new coal mine waste piles consisting
of mine wastes, tailings, coal processing wastes, or other liquid and solid
wastes, and used either temporarily or permanently as dams or embankments.
(n)  Insure that all debris, acid-forming materials, toxic materials, or
materials constituting a fire hazard are treated or buried and compacted or
otherwise disposed of in a manner designed to prevent contamination of ground
or surface waters and that contingency plans are developed to prevent
sustained combustion.
(o)  Insure that explosives are used only in accordance with existing state
and federal law and the rules adopted by the board, which shall include
provisions to:
(i)  provide adequate advance written notice to local governments and
residents who might be affected by the use of the explosives by:
(A)  publication of the planned blasting schedule:

within 1/2 mile of the proposed blasting site and by providing daily notice to
resident/occupiers in these areas prior to any blasting;
(ii)  maintain for a period of at least three years and make available for
public inspection upon request a log detailing the location of the blasts, the
pattern and depth of the drill holes, the amount of explosives used per hole,
and the order and length of delay in the blasts;
(iii)  limit the type of explosives and detonating equipment, the size, the
timing and frequency of blasts based upon the physical conditions of the site
so as to prevent injury to persons, damage to public and private property
outside the permit area, adverse impacts on any underground mine, and change
in the course, channel, or availability of ground or surface water outside the
permit area;
(iv)  require that all blasting operations be conducted by trained and
competent persons, and to implement this requirement, the division shall
promulgate rules requiring the training, examination, and certification of
persons engaging in or directly responsible for blasting or the use of
explosives in surface and coal mining operations; and
(v)  provide that upon the request of a resident or owner of a man-made
dwelling or structure within 1/2 mile of any portion of the permitted area,
the applicant or permittee shall conduct a preblasting survey of the
structures and submit the survey to the division and a copy to the resident or
owner making the request, the area of which survey shall be decided by the
division and shall include such provisions as promulgated.
(p)  Insure that all reclamation efforts proceed in an environmentally sound
manner and as contemporaneously as practicable with the surface coal mining
operations; but where the applicant proposes to combine surface mining
operations with underground mining operations to assure maximum practical
recovery of the mineral resources, the division may grant a variance for
specific areas within the reclamation plan from the requirement that
reclamation efforts proceed as contemporaneously as practicable to permit
underground operations prior to reclamation:
(i)  if the division finds in writing that:
(A)  the applicant has presented, as part of the permit application, specific,
feasible plans for the proposed underground mining operations;
(B)  the proposed underground mining operations are necessary or desirable to
assure maximum practical recovery of the mineral resource and will avoid
multiple disturbance of the surface;

mining operations and until the requirements of this Subsection (2) and
Section 40-10-16 have been fully complied with.
(q)  Insure that the construction, maintenance, and postmining conditions of
access roads into and across the site of operations will control or prevent
erosion and siltation, pollution of water, damage to fish or wildlife or their
habitat, or public or private property.
(r)  Refrain from the construction of roads or other access ways up a stream
bed or drainage channel or in such proximity to the channel so as to seriously
alter the normal flow of water.
(s)  Establish on the regraded areas and all other lands affected, a diverse,
effective, and permanent vegetative cover of the same seasonal variety native
to the area of land to be affected and capable of self-regeneration and plant
succession at least equal in extent of cover to the natural vegetation of the
area; except that introduced species may be used in the revegetation process
where desirable and necessary to achieve the approved postmining land use
plan.
(t) (i)  Assume the responsibility for successful revegetation, as required by
Subsection (2)(s), for a period of five full years after the last year of
augmented seeding, fertilizing, irrigation, or other work in order to assure
compliance with Subsection (2)(s), except in those areas or regions of the
state where the annual average precipitation is 26 inches or less, then the
operator's assumption of responsibility and liability will extend for a period
of ten full years after the last year of augmented seeding, fertilizing,
irrigation, or other work; but when the division approves a long-term
intensive agricultural postmining land use, the applicable five or ten-year
period of responsibility for revegetation shall commence at the date of
initial planting for this long-term intensive, agricultural postmining land
use, except when the division issues a written finding approving a long-term,
intensive, agricultural postmining land use, as part of the mining and
reclamation plan, the division may grant exception to the provisions of
Subsection (2)(s); and
(ii)  on lands eligible for remining, assume the responsibility for successful
revegetation for a period of two full years after the last year of augmented
seeding, fertilizing, irrigation, or other work in order to assure compliance
with the applicable standards, except in areas of the state where the average
annual precipitation is 26 inches or less, assume the responsibility for
successful revegetation for a period of five full years after the last year of
augmented seeding, fertilizing, irrigation, or other work in order to assure
compliance with the applicable standards.
(u)  Protect offsite areas from slides or damage occurring during the surface
coal mining and reclamation operations and not deposit spoil material or
locate any part of the operations or waste accumulations outside the permit
area.
(v)  Place all excess spoil material resulting from coal surface mining and
reclamation activities in a manner that:
(i)  spoil is transported and placed in a controlled manner in position for
concurrent compaction and in a way to assure mass stability and to prevent
mass movement;
(ii)  the areas of disposal are within the bonded permit areas and all organic
matter shall be removed immediately prior to spoil placement;
(iii)  appropriate surface and internal drainage systems and diversion ditches
are used so as to prevent spoil erosion and movement;
(iv)  the disposal area does not contain springs, natural water courses, or
wet weather seeps unless lateral drains are constructed from the wet areas to
the main underdrains in a manner that filtration of the water into the spoil
pile will be prevented;
(v)  if placed on a slope, the spoil is placed upon the most moderate slope
among those upon which, in the judgment of the division, the spoil could be
placed in compliance with all the requirements of this chapter and shall be
placed, where possible, upon or above a natural terrace, bench, or berm, if
this placement provides additional stability and prevents mass movement;
(vi)  where the toe of the spoil rests on a downslope, a rock toe buttress of
sufficient size to prevent mass movement, is constructed;
(vii)  the final configuration is compatible with the natural drainage pattern
and surroundings and suitable for intended uses;
(viii)  design of the spoil disposal area is certified by a qualified
professional engineer, and to implement this requirement, the division shall
promulgate rules regarding the certification of engineers in the area of spoil
disposal design; and
(ix)  all other provisions of this chapter are met.
(w)  Meet such other criteria as are necessary to achieve reclamation in
accordance with the purposes of this chapter, taking into consideration the
physical, climatological, and other characteristics of the site.
(x)  To the extent possible, using the best technology currently available,
minimize disturbances and adverse impacts of the operation on fish, wildlife,
and related environmental values, and achieve enhancement of these resources
where practicable.
(y)  Provide for an undisturbed natural barrier beginning at the elevation of
the lowest coal seam to be mined and extending from the outslope for the
distance as the division shall determine shall be retained in place as a
barrier to slides and erosion.
(3) (a)  Where an applicant meets the requirements of Subsections (3)(b) and
(c), a permit without regard to the requirement to restore to approximate
original contour provided in Subsections (2)(c), (4)(b), and (4)(c) may be
granted for the surface mining of coal where the mining operation will remove
an entire coal seam or seams running through the upper fraction of a mountain,
ridge, or hill (except as provided in this Subsection (3)) by removing all of
the overburden and creating a level plateau or a gently rolling contour with
no highwalls remaining, and capable of supporting postmining uses in accord
with the requirements of this Subsection (3).
(b)  In cases where an industrial, commercial, agricultural, residential, or
public facility (including recreational facilities) use is proposed for the
postmining use of the affected land, the division may grant a permit for a
surface mining operation of the nature described in Subsection (3)(a) pursuant
to procedures and criteria set forth in the rules, including:
(i)  the applicant's presentation of specific plans for the proposed
postmining land use which meet criteria concerning the type of use proposed;
(ii)  the applicant's demonstration that the proposed use would be consistent
with adjacent land uses and existing state and local land use plans and
programs and with other requirements of this chapter; and
(iii)  procedures whereby the division provides the governing body of the unit
of general-purpose government in which the land is located and any state or
federal agency which the division, in its discretion, determines to have an
interest in the proposed use, an opportunity of not more than 60 days to
review and comment on the proposed use.
(c)  All permits granted under the provisions of this Subsection (3) shall be
reviewed not more than three years from the date of issuance of the permit,
unless the applicant affirmatively demonstrates that the proposed development
is proceeding in accordance with the terms of the approved schedule and
reclamation plan.
(4)  The following performance standards shall be applicable to steep-slope
surface coal mining and shall be in addition to those general performance
standards required by this section; but the provisions of this Subsection (4)
shall not apply to those situations in which an operator is mining on flat or
gently rolling terrain, on which an occasional steep slope is encountered
through which the mining operation is to proceed, leaving a plain or
predominantly flat area or where an operator is in compliance with provisions
of Subsection (3):
(a)  Insure that when performing surface coal mining on steep slopes, no
debris, abandoned or disabled equipment, spoil material, or waste mineral
matter be placed on the downslope below the bench or mining cut; but spoil
material in excess of that required for the reconstruction of the approximate
original contour under the provisions of Subsection (2)(c) or this Subsection
(4) shall be permanently stored pursuant to Subsection 40-10-17(2)(v).
(b)  Complete backfilling with spoil material shall be required to cover
completely the highwall and return the site to the appropriate original
contour, which material will maintain stability following mining and
reclamation.
(c)  The operator may not disturb land above the top of the highwall unless
the division finds that the disturbance will facilitate compliance with the
environmental protection standards of this section; but the land disturbed
above the highwall shall be limited to that amount necessary to facilitate
this compliance.
(d)  For the purposes of this Subsection (4), "steep slope" means any slope
above 20 degrees or such lesser slope as may be defined by the division after
consideration of soil, climate, and other characteristics of an area.
(5)  The board shall promulgate specific rules to govern the granting of
variances from the requirement to restore to approximate original contour
provided in Subsection (4)(b) pursuant to procedures and criteria set forth in
those rules including:
(a)  written request by the surface owner concerning the proposed use;
(b)  approval of the proposed use as an equal or better economic or public
use; and
(c)  approval of the proposed use as improving the watershed control in the
area and as using only such amount of spoil as is necessary to achieve the
planned postmining land use.
