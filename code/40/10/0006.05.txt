(1)  The board shall promulgate rules under this chapter in accordance with
Title 63G, Chapter 3, Utah Administrative Rulemaking Act.
(2)  Except as provided in Subsection (3), no rule which the board adopts for
the purpose of the state administering a program under the federal Surface
Mining Control and Reclamation Act may be more stringent than the
corresponding federal regulations which address the same circumstances.  In
adopting such rules, the board may incorporate by reference corresponding
federal regulations.
(3)  The board may adopt rules more stringent than corresponding federal
regulations for the purpose described in Subsection (2), only if it makes a

public safety and the environment of the state. Those findings shall be
accompanied by an opinion referring to and evaluating the public safety and
environmental information and studies contained in the record which form the
basis for the board's conclusion.
