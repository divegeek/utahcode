40-1-12.   Damages for wrongful removal of ores.
When damages are claimed for the extraction or selling of ore from any mine or
mining claim and the defendant, or those under whom he claims, holds, under
color of title adverse to the claims of the plaintiff, in good faith, then the
reasonable value of all labor bestowed or expenses incurred in necessary
developing, mining, transporting, concentrating, selling or preparing said
ore, or its mineral content, for market, must be allowed as an offset against
such damages; provided, however, that any person who, wrongfully entering upon
any mine or mining claim and carrying away ores therefrom, or wrongfully
extracting and selling ores from any mine, having knowledge of the existence
of adverse claimants in any mine or mining claim, and without notice to them,
knowingly and willfully trespasses in or upon such mine or mining claim and
extracts or sells ore therefrom shall be liable to the owners of such ore for
three times the value thereof without any deductions either for labor bestowed
or expenses incurred in removing, transporting, selling or preparing said ore,
or its mineral content for market.
