40-8-2.   Legislative findings.

The Utah Legislature finds that:

(1)  A mining industry is essential to the economic and physical well-being of the state of Utah and the nation.

(2)  It is necessary to alter the surface of the earth to extract minerals required by our society, but this should be done in such a way as to minimize undesirable effects on the surroundings.

(3)  Mined land should be reclaimed so as to prevent conditions detrimental to the general safety and welfare of the citizens of the state and to provide for the subsequent use of the lands affected. Reclamation requirements must be adapted to the diversity of topographic, chemical, climatic, biologic, geologic, economic, and social conditions in the areas where mining takes place.
