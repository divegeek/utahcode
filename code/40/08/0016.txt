(1)  An approved notice of intention or approved revision of it remains valid for the life of the mining operation, as stated in it, unless the board withdraws the approval as provided in Subsection (2).

(2)  The board or the division shall not withdraw approval of a notice of intention or revision of it, except as follows:

(a)  Approval may be withdrawn in the event that the operator substantially fails to perform reclamation or conduct mining operations so that the approved reclamation plan can be accomplished.

(b)  Approval may be withdrawn in the event that the operator fails to provide and maintain surety as may be required under this chapter.

(c)  Approval may be withdrawn in the event that mining operations are continuously shut down for a period in excess of five years, unless the extended period is accepted upon application of the operator.

(3)  Approval of a notice of intention may not be refused, withheld, nor withdrawn by the division until the operator, who holds or has applied for such approval, has had an opportunity to request a hearing before the board, present evidence, cross-examine, and participate fully in the proceedings.  Based on the record of the hearing, the board will issue an order concerning the refusal, withholding, or withdrawal of the notice of intention.  If no hearing is requested, the division may refuse, withhold, or withdraw approval of a notice of intention.

(4)  In the event that the division or the board withdraws approval of a notice of intention or its revision, all mining operations included under the notice shall be suspended in accordance with procedures and schedule approved by the division.
