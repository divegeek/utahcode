(6) (a)  If a nonconsenting owner's tract in the drilling unit is not subject to a lease or other contract for the development of oil and gas, the pooling order shall provide that the nonconsenting owner shall receive as a royalty the average landowner's royalty attributable to each tract within the drilling unit.

(i)  determined prior to the commencement of drilling; and

(ii)  paid from production attributable to each tract until the consenting owners have recovered the costs specified in Subsection (4)(d).
