(3) (a)  Any delay in determining whether a person is legally entitled to an interest in the oil and gas proceeds does not affect payments to other persons entitled to payment.

(b) (i)  If accrued payments cannot be made within the time limits specified in Subsection (1) or (2), the payor shall deposit all oil and gas proceeds credited to the eventual oil and gas proceeds owner to an escrow account in a federally insured bank or savings and loan institution using a standard escrow document form.

(7) (a)  If, after a hearing, the board finds the proceeds have not been deposited in an interest bearing escrow account in accordance with Subsection (3), the board may order that:

(i)  a complete accounting be made; and

(ii)  the proceeds be subject to an interest rate of 1-1/2% per month, as a substitute for an escrow account interest rate, accruing from the date the payment should have been suspended in accordance with Subsection (3).

(i)  if the proceeds have been deposited in an interest bearing escrow account in accordance with Subsection (3):

(B)  require the proceeds and accruing interest to remain in the escrow account; and

(C)  assess a penalty of up to 25% of the total proceeds and interest in the escrow account; or

(d)  If, after a hearing, the board finds the delay of payment is with reasonable justification and the proceeds have been deposited in an interest bearing escrow account in accordance with Subsection (3), the payor may not be required to make an accounting or payment of appropriately suspended proceeds until the condition which justified suspension has been satisfied.

(8)  The circumstances under which the board may find the suspension of payment of proceeds is made with reasonable justification, such that the penalty provisions of Subsections (7)(b) and (7)(c)(ii) do not apply, include, but are not limited to, the following:

(a)  the payor:

(i)  fails to make the payment in good faith reliance upon a title opinion by a licensed Utah attorney objecting to the lack of good and marketable title of record of the person claiming entitlement to payment; and

(ii)  furnishes a copy of the relevant portions of the opinion to the person for necessary curative action;

(b)  the payor receives information which:

(i)  in the payor's good faith judgment, brings into question the entitlement of the person claiming the right to the payment to receive that payment;

(ii)  has rendered the title unmarketable; or

(iii)  may expose the payor to the risk of liability to third parties if the payment is made;

(c)  the total amount of oil and gas proceeds in possession of the payor owed to the person making claim to payment is less than $100 at the end of any month; or

(d)  the person entitled to payment has failed or refused to execute a division or transfer order acknowledging the proper interest to which the person claims to be entitled and setting forth the mailing address to which payment may be directed, provided the division or transfer order does not alter or amend the terms of the lease.

(a)  suspend and escrow the payments in accordance with Subsection (3); or

(b)  at the request and expense of the person claiming entitlement to the payment, make the payment into court on an interpleader action to resolve the claim and avoid liability under this chapter.
