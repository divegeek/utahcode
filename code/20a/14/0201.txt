(b)  The county and municipal legislative bodies shall divide the school district so that the local school board districts are substantially equal in population and are as contiguous and compact as practicable.

(vi)  whenever a district receives new residents equal to at least 20% of the population of the district at the time of the last reapportionment because of a transfer of territory from another district; and

(vii)  whenever it is necessary to increase the membership of a board from five to seven members as a result of changes in student membership under Section 20A-14-202.

(b)  If a school district receives territory containing less than 20% of the population of the transferee district at the time of the last reapportionment, the local school board may assign the new territory to one or more existing school board districts.

(4) (a)  If, before an election affected by reapportionment, the county or municipal legislative body that conducted the reapportionment determines that one or more members shall be elected to terms of two years to meet this part's requirements for staggered terms, the legislative body shall determine by lot which of the reapportioned local school board districts will elect members to two-year terms and which will elect members to four-year terms.

(b)  All subsequent elections are for four-year terms.

(5)  Within 10 days after any local school board district boundary change, the county or municipal legislative body making the change shall send an accurate map or plat of the boundary change to the Automated Geographic Reference Center created under Section 63F-1-506.
