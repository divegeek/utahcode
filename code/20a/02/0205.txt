"REGISTERING TO VOTE

If you are not registered to vote where you live now, would you like to apply to register to vote here today? (Applying to register to vote or declining to register to vote will not affect the amount of assistance that you will be provided by this agency.)

If you would like help in filling out the voter registration application form, we will help you.  The decision about whether or not to seek or accept help is yours.  You may fill out the application form in private.  If you believe that someone has interfered with your right to register or to decline to register to vote, your right to privacy in deciding whether or not to register, or in applying to register to vote, or your right to choose your own political party or other political preference, you may file a complaint with the Office of the Lieutenant Governor, State Capitol Building, Salt Lake City, Utah 84114.
