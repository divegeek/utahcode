(2) (a)  If a municipality is using ballot sheets or electronic ballots, the election officer may require that:

(i)  the ballot, or ballot label in the case of a punch card ballot, for a regular primary election consist of several groups of pages or display screens, so that a separate group can be used to list the names of candidates seeking nomination of each qualified political party, with additional groups used to list candidates for other nonpartisan offices;

(ii)  the separate groups of pages or display screens are identified by color or other suitable means; and

(iii)  the ballot or ballot label contain instructions that direct the voter how to vote the ballot.

(b)  If a municipality is using ballot sheets or electronic ballots, each election officer shall:

(i)  for municipalities using punch card ballots, ensure that the ballot label provides a means for the voter to designate the political party in whose primary the voter is voting; and

(ii)  determine the order for printing the names of the political parties on the ballot label in accordance with Section 20A-6-305.
