20A-7-502.5.   Initial fiscal impact estimate -- Preparation of estimate --
Challenge to estimate.
(1)  Within three working days of receipt of an application for an initiative
petition, the local clerk shall submit a copy of the application to the budget
officer.
(2) (a)  The budget officer shall prepare an unbiased, good faith estimate of
the fiscal impact of the law proposed by the initiative that contains:
(i)  a dollar amount representing the total estimated fiscal impact of the
proposed law;
(ii)  if the proposed law would increase or decrease taxes, a dollar amount
representing the total estimated increase or decrease for each type of tax
affected under the proposed law and a dollar amount representing the total
estimated increase or decrease in taxes under the proposed law;
(iii)  if the proposed law would result in the issuance or a change in the
status of bonds, notes, or other debt instruments, a dollar amount
representing the total estimated increase or decrease in public debt under the
proposed law;
(iv)  a listing of all sources of funding for the estimated costs associated
with the proposed law showing each source of funding and the percentage of
total funding provided from each source;
(v)  a dollar amount representing the estimated costs or savings, if any, to
state and local government entities under the proposed law; and
(vi)  a concise explanation, not exceeding 100 words, of the above information
and of the estimated fiscal impact, if any, under the proposed law.
(b) (i)  If the proposed law is estimated to have no fiscal impact, the local
budget officer shall include a summary statement in the initial fiscal impact
statement in substantially the following form:
"The (title of the local budget officer) estimates that the law proposed by
this initiative would have no significant fiscal impact and would not result
in either an increase or decrease in taxes or debt."
(ii)  If the proposed law is estimated to have a fiscal impact, the local
budget officer shall include a summary statement in the initial fiscal impact
estimate in substantially the following form:
"The (title of the local budget officer) estimates that the law proposed by
this initiative would result in a total fiscal expense/savings of $______,
which includes a (type of tax or taxes) tax increase/decrease of $______ and a
$______ increase/decrease in public debt."
(iii)  If the estimated fiscal impact of the proposed law is highly variable
or is otherwise difficult to reasonably express in a summary statement, the
local budget officer may include in the summary statement a brief explanation
that identifies those factors affecting the variability or difficulty of the
estimate.
(3)  Within 25 calendar days from the date that the local clerk delivers a
copy of the application, the budget officer shall:
(a)  deliver a copy of the initial fiscal impact estimate to the local clerk's
office; and
(b)  mail a copy of the initial fiscal impact estimate to the first five
sponsors named in the application.
(4) (a)  Three or more of the sponsors of the petition may, within 20 calendar
days of the date of delivery of the initial fiscal impact estimate to the
local clerk's office, file a petition with the Supreme Court, alleging that
the initial fiscal impact estimate, taken as a whole, is an inaccurate
estimate of the fiscal impact of the initiative.
(b) (i)  There is a presumption that the initial fiscal impact estimate
prepared by the budget officer is based upon reasonable assumptions, uses
reasonable data, and applies accepted analytical methods to present the
estimated fiscal impact of the initiative.
(ii)  The Supreme Court may not revise the contents of, or direct the revision
of, the initial fiscal impact estimate unless the plaintiffs rebut the
presumption by clear and convincing evidence that establishes that the fiscal
estimate, taken as a whole, is an inaccurate statement of the estimated fiscal
impact of the initiative.
(c)  The Supreme Court shall, within 30 calendar days of the date that the
appeal is filed, certify to the local clerk an initial fiscal impact estimate
for the measure that meets the requirements of this section.
