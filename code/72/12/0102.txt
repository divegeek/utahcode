72-12-102.   Legislative findings and policy.

(1)  The Legislature finds that:

(a)  increasingly heavy commuting burdens on Utah's freeways and major transportation arteries are gradually aggravating driving conditions for all Utah motorists;

(b)  single-occupant driving is the predominant mode of transportation used by commuters in Utah;

(c)  single-occupant driving represents the most costly and most excessive use of dwindling petroleum reserves; and

(d)  rapidly increasing energy costs represent an ever-growing burden on commuters' work-related expenses.

(2)  The policy of this state is to support and encourage transportation modes and ride-sharing programs that reduce the number of vehicle miles traveled, thereby reducing gasoline consumption and protecting the environment.
