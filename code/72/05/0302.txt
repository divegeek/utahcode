(3) (a)  Acceptance of a right-of-way for the construction of a highway over public lands, not reserved for public uses, is presumed if the state or a political subdivision of the state makes a finding that the highway was constructed and the right-of-way was accepted prior to October 21, 1976.

(b)  The existence of a highway in a condition suitable for public use establishes a presumption that the highway has continued in use in its present location since the land over which it is built was public land not reserved for public use.

(b)  Unless specifically determined by the state or political subdivision of the state with the authority over the R.S. 2477 right-of-way, an R.S. 2477 right-of-way is presumed to be at least 66 feet wide if that is the usual width of highway rights-of-way in the area.

(c)  The scope of the R.S. 2477 right-of-way includes the right to widen the highway as necessary to accommodate the increased travel associated with those uses, up to, where applicable, improving a highway to two lanes so travelers can safely pass each other.
