72-10-402.   Declaration with respect to airport hazards.
The Legislature finds that:
(1)  an airport hazard endangers the lives and property of users of the
airport and of occupants of land in its vicinity;
(2)  an obstruction of the type that reduces the size of the area available
for the landing, taking-off, and maneuvering of aircraft tends to destroy or
impair the utility of the airport and the public investment in the airport;
(3)  the creation or establishment of an airport hazard is a public nuisance
and an injury to the community served by the airport in question;
(4)  it is necessary in the interest of the public health, public safety, and
general welfare that the creation or establishment of airport hazards be
prevented;
(5)  this should be accomplished, to the extent legally possible, by exercise
of the police power, without compensation; and
(6)  both the prevention of the creation or establishment of airport hazards
and the elimination, removal, alteration, mitigation, or marking and lighting
of existing airport hazards are public purposes for which political
subdivisions may raise and expend public funds and acquire land or property
interests in land.
