in law other than this chapter, an institution may delegate to an external
agent the management and investment of an institutional fund to the extent
that an institution could prudently delegate under the circumstances.

purposes of the institution and the institutional fund; and
(iii)  periodically reviewing the agent's actions in order to monitor the
agent's performance and compliance with the scope and terms of the delegation.

institution to exercise reasonable care to comply with the scope and terms of
the delegation.
(3)  An institution that complies with Subsection (1) is not liable for the
decisions or actions of an agent to which the function was delegated.

related to the delegation or the performance of the delegated function.

committees, officers, or employees as authorized by law other than this
