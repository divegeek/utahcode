(b)  exercising reasonable care, skill, and caution in order to meet the standard of care of a prudent investor.

(2)  In determining whether the state treasurer has met the standard of care of a prudent investor, a finder of fact shall:

(ii)  as a part of an overall investment strategy that has risk and return objectives reasonably suited to the permanent state trust fund.
