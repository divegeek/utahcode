(1)  The division may:

(a)  take by purchase, grant, gift, devise, or bequest, any property, real or personal, for any purpose appropriate to its objects; and

(b)  convert property received by gift, grant, devise, or bequest and not suitable for its uses, into other property so available or into money.

(2)  The property received or converted under Subsection (1) shall be held, invested, and managed and its proceeds used by the division for the purposes and under the conditions prescribed in the grant or donation.

(3)  If by the terms of any grant, gift, devise, or bequest, conditions are imposed that are impracticable under the law, the grant or donation does not fail but the conditions shall be rejected and the intent of the grantor or donor carried out as nearly as may be.

(4)  A grant, gift, devise, or bequest for the benefit of the division may not be defeated or prejudiced by any misnomer, misdescription, or informality if the intention of the grantor or donor can be shown or ascertained with reasonable certainty.
