(2)  If a conveyance of trust funds under Subsection (1) would constitute a violation of the trust agreement governing the trust funds, conveyance of those funds is not required, and those funds may continue to be used in accordance with the trust agreement for any library facility specified in the trust agreement, even after the facility becomes a county library facility because of consolidation.
