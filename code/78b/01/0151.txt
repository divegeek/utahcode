78B-1-151.   Witnesses -- Expenses for expert witnesses.

(1)  The court may appoint any expert witness agreed upon by the parties or of its own selection.  The court shall inform the expert of required duties in writing and a copy shall be filed with the court record.

(2)  The appointed expert shall advise the court and the parties of findings and may be called to testify by the court or by any party.   The expert witness is subject to cross-examination by each party.

(3)  The court shall determine the reasonable compensation of the expert and order payment.  The parties may call expert witnesses of their own at their own expense.  Upon a showing that a defendant is financially unable to pay the compensation of an expert whose services are necessary for an adequate defense, the compensation shall be paid as if  the expert were called on behalf of the prosecution.

(4)  Payment by the court for an expert witness in a criminal case is limited to the fee and mileage allowance for witnesses under Section 78B-1-119 and necessary meals and lodging expenses as provided by rule of the Judicial Council.  Compensation of an expert witness beyond the statutory fee and mileage allowance shall be paid by the parties under Subsection (3).
