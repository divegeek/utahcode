78B-5-604.   Certificate of location or purchase of public lands of United
States as evidence.
A certificate of purchase or of location of any lands in this state, issued or
made in pursuance of any law of the United States, is prima facie evidence
that the holder or assignee of the certificate is the owner of the land
described in the certificate.  This evidence may be overcome by proof that the
land was in the adverse possession of the adverse party, or those under whom
the party claims, or that the adverse party was holding the land for mining
purposes at the time the certificate is filed.
