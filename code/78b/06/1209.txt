78B-6-1209.   Partial partition allowed -- When.
(1)  If the court determines that it is impracticable or highly inconvenient
to make a complete partition among all the parties in interest, the court may
first determine the shares or interests respectively held by the original
cotenants as if they were the only parties to the action.
(2)  After the initial partition, the court may partition separately each
portion allotted among those claiming under a specific tenant whose interest
was determined in Subsection (1), unless the parties choose to remain as
tenants in common.
