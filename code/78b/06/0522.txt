out of this chapter, the private property owner may submit the dispute for
mediation or arbitration to the private property ombudsman under Section
13-43-204.
(2)  An action submitted to the private property ombudsman under authority of
this section does not bar or stay any action for occupancy of premises

(3) (a) (i)  A mediator or arbitrator, acting at the request of the property
owner under Section 13-43-204, has standing in an action brought in district
court under this chapter to file with the court a motion to stay the action
during the pendency of the mediation or arbitration.
(ii)  A mediator or arbitrator may not file a motion to stay under Subsection
(3)(a)(i) unless the mediator or arbitrator certifies at the time of filing
the motion that a stay is reasonably necessary to reach a resolution of the
case through mediation or arbitration.
(b)  If a stay is granted pursuant to a motion under Subsection (3)(a) and the
order granting the stay does not specify when the stay terminates, the
mediator or arbitrator shall file with the district court a motion to
terminate the stay within 30 days after:

appraisal.
