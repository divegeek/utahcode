78B-6-305.   Duty of sheriff -- Excuse for nonappearance -- Unnecessary
restraint forbidden.
(1)  Upon executing the warrant of attachment, the sheriff shall keep the
person in custody and bring the person before the court or judge until an
order is made in the premises, unless the person arrested posts bail as
provided in Section 78B-6-306.
(2)  Whenever by the provisions of this chapter an officer is required to keep
in custody a person arrested on a warrant of attachment and to bring the
person before a court or judge, the inability from illness or otherwise of the
person to attend is a sufficient excuse for not bringing the person up; and
the officer must not confine a person arrested upon the warrant in a prison or
otherwise restrain the person of personal liberty, except so far as may be
necessary to secure the person's personal attendance.
