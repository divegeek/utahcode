78B-6-311.   Damages to party aggrieved.
If an actual loss or injury to a party in an action or special proceeding is
caused by the contempt, the court, in lieu of or in addition to the fine or
imprisonment imposed for the contempt, may order the person proceeded against
to pay the party aggrieved a sum of money sufficient to indemnify him and to
satisfy his costs and expenses.  The order and the acceptance of money under
it is a bar to an action by the aggrieved party for the loss and injury.
