78B-6-1105.   Tobacco smoke -- Legislative intent.

(1)  The Legislature finds:

(a)  the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has determined that environmental tobacco smoke is a Group A carcinogen, in the same category as other cancer-causing chemicals such as asbestos;

(b)  the EPA has determined that there is no acceptable level of exposure to Class A carcinogens; and

(c)  the EPA has determined that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke also causes an increase in respiratory diseases and disorders among exposed persons.

(2)  The Legislature finds that environmental tobacco smoke generated in a rental or condominium unit may drift into other units, exposing the occupants of those units to tobacco smoke, and that standard construction practices are not effective in preventing this drift of tobacco smoke.

(3)  The Legislature further finds that persons who desire to not be exposed to drifting environmental tobacco smoke should be able to determine in advance of entering into a rental, lease, or purchase agreement whether the subject unit may be exposed to environmental tobacco smoke.
