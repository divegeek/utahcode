78B-3-201.   Title -- Purpose.
(1)  This part is known as the "Nonresident Jurisdiction Act."
(2)  It is declared, as a matter of legislative policy, that the public
interest demands the state provide its citizens with an effective means of
redress against nonresident persons, who, through certain significant minimal
contacts with this state, incur obligations to citizens entitled to the
state's protection.  This legislative action is necessary because of
technological progress which has substantially increased the flow of commerce
between the several states resulting in increased interaction between persons
of this state and persons of other states.
(3)  The provisions of this part, to ensure maximum protection to citizens of
this state, should be applied so as to assert jurisdiction over nonresident
defendants to the fullest extent permitted by the due process clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
