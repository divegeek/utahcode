Insurance commissioner may require joint underwriting authority.

liability insurance coverage for health care providers is not readily
available in the voluntary market in a specific part of this state, and that
the public interest requires that action be taken.

insurance coverage through all insurers issuing professional liability
policies and individual and group accident and sickness policies providing
medical, surgical or hospital expense coverage on either a prepaid or an
expense incurred basis, including personal injury protection and medical
expense coverage issued incidental to liability insurance policies.
