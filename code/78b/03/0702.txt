against:
(a)  any person who steals or, without provocation, attacks the service

sufficient control over the animal to prevent the attack.
(2)  The action authorized by this section maybe brought by a person with a
disability who uses the service animal, or the owner of the service animal.

(4)  If the unprovoked attack on a service animal results in injuries from
which the animal recovers so it is able to again function as a service animal
for the person with a disability, or if the theft of the service animal
results in the recovery of the service animal and the animal is again able to
function as a service animal for the person with a disability, the measure of
economic damages is the costs and expenses incurred by the person with a
disability or the owner as a result of the theft of or injury to the service
animal, and includes:
