78B-3-418.   Decision and recommendations of panel -- No judicial or other review.

(1) (a)  The panel shall issue an opinion and the division shall issue a certificate of compliance with the pre-litigation hearing requirements of this part in accordance with this section.

(b)  A certificate of compliance issued in accordance with this section is proof that the claimant has complied with all conditions precedent under this part prior to the commencement of litigation as required in Subsection 78B-3-412(1).

(c) (i)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, any party in a medical malpractice action or arbitration hearing may request a prelitigation panel review as to a health care provider and obtain a certificate of compliance for that specific, individual health care provider for the purpose of allocating fault to that health care provider.  A party in a medical malpractice action or arbitration hearing may not attempt to allocate fault to any health care provider unless a certificate of compliance has been issued in accordance with this section for that specific, individual health care provider.  A health care provider exempted from the requirement of a prelitigation hearing by statute or an arbitration agreement, may nevertheless be joined in a prelitigation hearing to satisfy the requirements of this section.

(b)  There is no judicial or other review or appeal of the panel's decision or recommendations.

(a)  for a named respondent, the panel issues an opinion of merit under Subsections (2)(a)(i) and (ii);

(b)  for a named respondent, the claimant files an affidavit of merit in accordance with Section 78B-3-423 if the opinion under Subsection (1)(a) is non-meritorious under either Subsection (2)(a)(i) or (ii);
