order provisions to intentionally or knowingly induce the respondent to
violate the protective order;
(c)  the petitioner's actions demonstrate that the petitioner no longer has a
reasonable fear of the respondent; and

any crime of violence subsequent to the issuance of the protective order, and
there are no unresolved charges involving violent conduct still on file with
the court.

determines that either party acted:
