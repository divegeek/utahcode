(c)  the petitioner's actions demonstrate that the petitioner no longer has a reasonable fear of the respondent; and

(d)  the respondent has not been convicted of a protective order violation or any crime of violence subsequent to the issuance of the protective order, and there are no unresolved charges involving violent conduct still on file with the court.
