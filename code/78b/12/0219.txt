78B-12-219.   Adjustment when child becomes emancipated.
(1)  When a child becomes 18 years of age or graduates from high school during
the child's normal and expected year of graduation, whichever occurs later, or
if the child dies, marries, becomes a member of the armed forces of the United
States, or is emancipated in accordance with Title 78A, Chapter 6, Part 8,
Emancipation, the base child support award is automatically adjusted to the
base combined child support obligation for the remaining number of children
due child support, shown in the table that was used to establish the most
recent order, using the incomes of the parties as specified in that order or
the worksheets, unless otherwise provided in the child support order.
(2)  The award may not be reduced by a per child amount derived from the base
child support award originally ordered.
(3)  If the incomes of the parties are not specified in the most recent order
or the worksheets, the information regarding the incomes is not consistent, or
the order deviates from the guidelines, automatic adjustment of the order does
not apply and the order will continue until modified by the issuing tribunal.
If the order is deviated and the parties subsequently obtain a judicial order
that adjusts the support back to the date of the emancipation of the child,
the Office of Recovery Services may not be required to repay any difference in
the support collected during the interim.
