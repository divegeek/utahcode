78B-12-212.   Medical expenses.

(1) (a)  The court shall order that insurance for the medical expenses of the minor children be provided by a parent if it is available at a reasonable cost.

(b)  The court shall, in accordance with Section 30-3-5, designate which health, hospital, or dental insurance plan is primary and which health, hospital, or dental insurance plan is secondary if at any time a dependent child is covered by both parents' health, hospital, or dental insurance plans.

(2)  In determining which parent shall be ordered to maintain insurance for medical expenses, the court or administrative agency may consider the:

(a)  reasonableness of the cost;

(b)  availability of a group insurance policy;

(c)  coverage of the policy; and

(d)  preference of the custodial parent.

(3)  The order shall require each parent to share equally the out-of-pocket costs of the premium actually paid by a parent for the children's portion of insurance unless the court finds good cause to order otherwise.

(4)  The parent who provides the insurance coverage may receive credit against the base child support award or recover the other parent's share of the children's portion of the premium.  In cases in which the parent does not have insurance but another member of the parent's household provides insurance coverage for the children, the parent may receive credit against the base child support award or recover the other parent's share of the children's portion of the premium.

(5)  The children's portion of the premium is a per capita share of the premium actually paid.  The premium expense for the children shall be calculated by dividing the premium amount by the number of persons covered under the policy and multiplying the result by the number of children in the instant case.

(6)  The order shall, in accordance with Subsection 30-3-5(1)(b), include a cash medical support provision that requires each parent to equally share all reasonable and necessary uninsured and unreimbursed medical and dental expenses incurred for the dependent children, including but not limited to deductibles and copayments unless the court finds good cause to order otherwise.

(7)  The parent ordered to maintain insurance shall provide verification of coverage to the other parent, or to the Office of Recovery Services under Title IV of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 601 et seq., upon initial enrollment of the dependent children, and thereafter on or before January 2 of each calendar year.  The parent shall notify the other parent, or the Office of Recovery Services under Title IV of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 601 et seq., of any change of insurance carrier, premium, or benefits within 30 calendar days of the date the parent first knew or should have known of the change.

(8)  A parent who incurs medical expenses shall provide written verification of the cost and payment of medical expenses to the other parent within 30 days of payment.

(9)  In addition to any other sanctions provided by the court, a parent incurring medical expenses may be denied the right to receive credit for the expenses or to recover the other parent's share of the expenses if that parent fails to comply with Subsections (7) and (8).
