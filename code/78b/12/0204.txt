78B-12-204.   Adjusted gross income.
(1)  As used in this chapter, "adjusted gross income" is the amount calculated
by subtracting from gross income alimony previously ordered and paid and child
support previously ordered.
(2)  The guidelines do not reduce the total child support award by adjusting
the gross incomes of the parents for alimony ordered in the pending
proceeding.  In establishing alimony, the court shall consider that in
determining the child support, the guidelines do not provide a deduction from
gross income for alimony.
