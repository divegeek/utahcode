(2)  Waiver and estoppel may not be applied against any third party or public entity that may provide support for the child.

(3)  A noncustodial parent, or alleged biological father in a paternity action, may not rely on statements made by the custodial parent of the child concerning child support unless the statements are reduced to writing and signed by both parties.
