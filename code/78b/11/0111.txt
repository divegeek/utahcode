78B-11-111.   Consolidation of separate arbitration proceedings.
(1)  Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (3), upon motion of a party to
an agreement to arbitrate or to an arbitration proceeding, the court may order
consolidation of separate arbitration proceedings as to all or some of the
claims if:
(a)  there are separate agreements to arbitrate or separate arbitration
proceedings between the same persons or one of them is a party to a separate
agreement to arbitrate or a separate arbitration proceeding with a third
person;
(b)  the claims subject to the agreements to arbitrate arise in substantial
part from the same transaction or series of related transactions;
(c)  the existence of a common issue of law or fact creates the possibility of
conflicting decisions in the separate arbitration proceedings; and
(d)  prejudice resulting from a failure to consolidate is not outweighed by
the risk of undue delay or prejudice to the rights of or hardship to parties
opposing consolidation.
(2)  The court may order consolidation of separate arbitration proceedings as
to some claims and allow other claims to be resolved in separate arbitration
proceedings.
(3)  The court may not order consolidation of the claims of a party to an
agreement to arbitrate if the agreement prohibits consolidation.
