(1)  An arbitrator shall make a record of an award.  The record must be signed
or otherwise authenticated by any arbitrator who concurs with the award.  The
arbitrator or the arbitration organization shall give notice of the award,
including a copy of the award, to each party to the arbitration proceeding.
(2)  An award must be made within the time specified by the agreement to
arbitrate or, if not specified in the agreement, within the time ordered by
the court.  The court may extend or the parties to the arbitration proceeding
may agree on the record to extend the time.  The court or the parties may do
