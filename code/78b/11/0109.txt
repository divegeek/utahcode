78B-11-109.   Provisional remedies.
(1)  Before an arbitrator is appointed and is authorized and able to act, the
court, upon motion of a party to an arbitration proceeding and for good cause
shown, may enter an order for provisional remedies to protect the
effectiveness of the arbitration proceeding to the same extent and under the
same conditions as if the controversy were the subject of a civil action.
(2)  After an arbitrator is appointed and is authorized and able to act:
(a)  the arbitrator may issue orders for provisional remedies, including
interim awards, as the arbitrator finds necessary to protect the effectiveness
of the arbitration proceeding and to promote the fair and expeditious
resolution of the controversy, to the same extent and under the same
conditions as if the controversy were the subject of a civil action; and
(b)  a party to an arbitration proceeding may move the court for a provisional
remedy only if the matter is urgent and the arbitrator is not able to act
timely or the arbitrator cannot provide an adequate remedy.
(3)  A party does not waive a right of arbitration by making a motion under
Subsection (1) or (2).
