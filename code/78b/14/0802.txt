78B-14-802.   Conditions of rendition.
(1)  Before making demand that the governor of another state surrender an
individual charged criminally in this state with having failed to provide for
the support of an obligee, the governor of this state may require a prosecutor
of this state to demonstrate that at least 60 days previously the obligee had
initiated proceedings for support pursuant to this chapter or that the
proceeding would be of no avail.
(2)  If, under this chapter or a law substantially similar to this chapter,
the governor of another state makes a demand that the governor of this state
surrender an individual charged criminally in that state with having failed to
provide for the support of a child or other individual to whom a duty of
support is owed, the governor may require a prosecutor to investigate the
demand and report whether a proceeding for support has been initiated or would
be effective.  If it appears that a proceeding would be effective but has not
been initiated, the governor may delay honoring the demand for a reasonable
time to permit the initiation of a proceeding.
(3)  If a proceeding for support has been initiated and the individual whose
rendition is demanded prevails, the governor may decline to honor the demand.
If the petitioner prevails and the individual whose rendition is demanded is
subject to a support order, the governor may decline to honor the demand if
the individual is complying with the support order.
