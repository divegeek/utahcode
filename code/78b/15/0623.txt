78B-15-623.   Binding effect of determination of parentage.
(1)  Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (2), a determination of
parentage is binding on:
(a)  all signatories to a declaration or denial of paternity as provided in
Part 3, Voluntary Declaration of Paternity; and
(b)  all parties to an adjudication by a tribunal acting under circumstances
that satisfy the jurisdictional requirements of Section 78B-14-201.
(2)  A child is not bound by a determination of parentage under this chapter
unless:
(a)  the determination was based on an unrescinded declaration of paternity
and the declaration is consistent with the results of genetic testing;
(b)  the adjudication of parentage was based on a finding consistent with the
results of genetic testing and the consistency is declared in the
determination or is otherwise shown; or
(c)  the child was a party or was represented in the proceeding determining
parentage by a guardian ad litem.
(3)  In a proceeding to dissolve a marriage, the tribunal is considered to
have made an adjudication of the parentage of a child if the question of
paternity is raised and the tribunal adjudicates according to Part 6,
Adjudication of Parentage, and the final order:
(a)  expressly identifies a child as a "child of the marriage," "issue of the
marriage," or similar words indicating that the husband is the father of the
child; or
(b)  provides for support of the child by the husband unless paternity is
specifically disclaimed in the order.
(4)  The tribunal is not considered to have made an adjudication of the
parentage of a child if the child was born at the time of entry of the order
and other children are named as children of the marriage, but that child is
specifically not named.
(5)  Once the paternity of a child has been adjudicated, an individual who was
not a party to the paternity proceeding may not challenge the paternity,
unless:
(a)  the party seeking to challenge can demonstrate a fraud upon the tribunal;
(b)  the challenger can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the
challenger did not know about the adjudicatory proceeding or did not have a
reasonable opportunity to know of the proceeding; and
(c)  there would be harm to the child to leave the order in place.
(6)  A party to an adjudication of paternity may challenge the adjudication
only under law of this state relating to appeal, vacation of judgments, or
other judicial review.
