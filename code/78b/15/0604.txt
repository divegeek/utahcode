(1)  An individual may not be adjudicated to be a parent unless the tribunal
has personal jurisdiction over the individual.
(2)  A tribunal of this state having jurisdiction to adjudicate parentage may
exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident individual, or the guardian
or conservator of the individual, if the conditions prescribed in Section
78B-14-201 are fulfilled, or the individual has signed a declaration of
paternity.
(3)  Lack of jurisdiction over one individual does not preclude the tribunal
from making an adjudication of parentage binding on another individual over
whom the tribunal has personal jurisdiction.
