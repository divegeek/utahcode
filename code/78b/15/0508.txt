78B-15-508.   Genetic testing when specimens not available.
(1)  Subject to Subsection (2), if a genetic-testing specimen is not available
from a man who may be the father of a child, for good cause and under
extraordinary circumstances the tribunal considers to be just, the tribunal
may order the following individuals to submit specimens for genetic testing:
(a)  the parents of the man;
(b)  brothers and sisters of the man;
(c)  other children of the man and their mothers; and
(d)  other relatives of the man necessary to complete genetic testing.
(2)  Issuance of an order under this section requires a finding that a need
for genetic testing outweighs the legitimate interests of the individual
sought to be tested.
