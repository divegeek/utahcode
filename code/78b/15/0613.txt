(1)  Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (3), a record of a genetic-testing expert is admissible as evidence of the truth of the facts asserted in the report unless a party objects to its admission within 14 days after its receipt by the objecting party and cites specific grounds for exclusion.  Unless a party files a timely objection, testimony shall be in affidavit form.  The admissibility of the report is not affected by whether the testing was performed:
