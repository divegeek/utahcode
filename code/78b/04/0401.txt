78B-4-401.   Public policy.
The Legislature finds that the sport of skiing is practiced by a large number
of residents of Utah and attracts a large number of nonresidents,
significantly contributing to the economy of this state.  It further finds
that few insurance carriers are willing to provide liability insurance
protection to ski area operators and that the premiums charged by those
carriers have risen sharply in recent years due to confusion as to whether a
skier assumes the risks inherent in the sport of skiing.  It is the purpose of
this act, therefore, to clarify the law in relation to skiing injuries and the
risks inherent in that sport, to establish as a matter of law that certain
risks are inherent in that sport, and to provide that, as a matter of public
policy, no person engaged in that sport shall recover from a ski operator for
injuries resulting from those inherent risks.
