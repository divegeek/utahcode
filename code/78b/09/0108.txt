(a)  modify the original conviction or sentence; or

(b)  vacate the original conviction or sentence and order a new trial or sentencing proceeding as appropriate.

(2) (a)  If the petitioner is serving a felony sentence, the order shall be stayed for five days.  Within the stay period, the respondent shall give written notice to the court and the petitioner that the respondent will pursue a new trial or sentencing proceedings, appeal the order, or take no action.
