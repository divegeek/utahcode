78B-9-106.   Preclusion of relief -- Exception.
(1)  A person is not eligible for relief under this chapter upon any ground
that:
(a)  may still be raised on direct appeal or by a post-trial motion;
(b)  was raised or addressed at trial or on appeal;
(c)  could have been but was not raised at trial or on appeal;
(d)  was raised or addressed in any previous request for post-conviction
relief or could have been, but was not, raised in a previous request for post-
conviction relief; or
(e)  is barred by the limitation period established in Section 78B-9-107.
(2)  The state may raise any of the procedural bars or time bar at any time,
including during the state's appeal from an order granting post-conviction
relief, unless the court determines that the state should have raised the time
bar or procedural bar at an earlier time. Any court may raise a procedural bar
or time bar on its own motion, provided that it gives the parties notice and
an opportunity to be heard.
(3)  Notwithstanding Subsection (1)(c), a person may be eligible for relief on
a basis that the ground could have been but was not raised at trial or on
appeal, if the failure to raise that ground was due to ineffective assistance
of counsel.
