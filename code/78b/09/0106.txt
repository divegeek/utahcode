(b)  was raised or addressed at trial or on appeal;

(c)  could have been but was not raised at trial or on appeal;

(d)  was raised or addressed in any previous request for post-conviction relief or could have been, but was not, raised in a previous request for post-conviction relief; or

(e)  is barred by the limitation period established in Section 78B-9-107.

(2) (a)  The state may raise any of the procedural bars or time bar at any time, including during the state's appeal from an order granting post-conviction relief, unless the court determines that the state should have raised the time bar or procedural bar at an earlier time.

(b)  Any court may raise a procedural bar or time bar on its own motion, provided that it gives the parties notice and an opportunity to be heard.

(3)  Notwithstanding Subsection (1)(c), a person may be eligible for relief on a basis that the ground could have been but was not raised at trial or on appeal, if the failure to raise that ground was due to ineffective assistance of counsel.
