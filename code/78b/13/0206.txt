78B-13-206.   Simultaneous proceedings.
(1)  Except as otherwise provided in Section 78B-13-204, a court of this state
may not exercise its jurisdiction under this chapter if at the time of the
commencement of the proceeding a proceeding concerning the custody of the
child had been previously commenced in a court of another state having
jurisdiction substantially in conformity with this chapter, unless the
proceeding has been terminated or is stayed by the court of the other state
because a court of this state is a more convenient forum under Section
78B-13-207.
(2)  Except as otherwise provided in Section 78B-13-204, a court of this
state, before hearing a child custody proceeding, shall examine the court
documents and other information supplied by the parties pursuant to Section
78B-13-209.  If the court determines that a child custody proceeding was
previously commenced in a court in another state having jurisdiction
substantially in accordance with this chapter, the court of this state shall
stay its proceeding and communicate with the court of the other state.  If the
court of the state having jurisdiction substantially in accordance with this
chapter does not determine that the court of this state is a more appropriate
forum, the court of this state shall dismiss the proceeding.
(3)  In a proceeding to modify a child custody determination, a court of this
state shall determine whether a proceeding to enforce the determination has
been commenced in another state.  If a proceeding to enforce a child custody
determination has been commenced in another state, the court may:
(a)  stay the proceeding for modification pending the entry of an order of a
court of the other state enforcing, staying, denying, or dismissing the
proceeding for enforcement;
(b)  enjoin the parties from continuing with the proceeding for enforcement;
or
(c)  proceed with the modification under conditions it considers appropriate.
