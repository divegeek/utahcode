78B-13-203.   Jurisdiction to modify determination.

Except as otherwise provided in Section 78B-13-204, a court of this state may not modify a child custody determination made by a court of another state unless a court of this state has jurisdiction to make an initial determination under Subsection 78B-13-201(1)(a) or (b) and:

(1)  the court of the other state determines it no longer has exclusive, continuing jurisdiction under Section 78B-13-202 or that a court of this state would be a more convenient forum under Section 78B-13-207; or

(2)  a court of this state or a court of the other state determines that neither the child, nor a parent, nor any person acting as a parent presently resides in the other state.
