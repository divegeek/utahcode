53-15-102.   Purpose.

(1)  The Legislature recognizes that children are often in dangerous situations that may be threatening or frightening to them and that there is a need for "safe homes" in our neighborhoods where a child may go for help.

(2)  The Legislature also recognizes that along with the need for "safe homes" that children can recognize easily, there is needed a method by which these homes can be identified.

(3)  The purpose of this chapter is to:

(a)  provide and designate a recognizable symbol for those "safe homes" that children can readily identify; and

(b)  establish a method by which local law enforcement agencies can identify and train volunteers who are willing to make their homes "safe homes".
