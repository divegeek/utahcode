(5)  The department shall adopt procedures governing the inspection of records, DNA specimens, and challenges to the accuracy of records.  The procedures shall accommodate the need to preserve the materials from contamination and destruction.

(6)  A person whose DNA specimen has been obtained under this part may, personally or through a legal representative, submit to the court a motion for a court order requiring the destruction of the person's DNA specimen and any criminal identification record created in connection with that specimen if:

(a) (i)  a final judgment reverses the conviction, judgment, or order that created an obligation to provide a DNA specimen; or

(ii)  all charges arising from the same criminal episode for which the DNA specimen was obtained under Subsection 53-10-404.5(1)(a) have been resolved by a final judgment of dismissal or acquittal; and

(b)  the department determines that the person has not otherwise become obligated to submit a DNA specimen as a result of any separate conviction or juvenile adjudication for any offense listed in Subsection 53-10-403(2).

(7)  A court order issued under Subsection (6) may be accompanied by a written notice to the person advising that state law provides for expungement of criminal charges if the charge is resolved by a final judgment of dismissal or acquittal.

(9)  The department is not required to destroy any item of physical evidence obtained from a DNA specimen if evidence relating to another person subject to the provisions of Sections 53-10-404 and 53-10-405 would as a result be destroyed.

(10)  A DNA specimen, physical evidence, or criminal identification record may not be affected by an order to set aside a conviction, except under the provisions of this section.

(11)  If funding is not available for analysis of any of the DNA specimens collected under this part, the bureau shall store the collected specimens until funding is made available for analysis through state or federal funds.

(12) (a) (i)  A person who, due to the person's employment or authority, has possession of or access to individually identifiable DNA information contained in the state criminal identification database or the state DNA specimen repository may not willfully disclose the information in any manner to any individual, agency, or entity that is not entitled under this part to receive the information.

(ii)  A person may not willfully obtain individually identifiable DNA information from the state criminal identification database or the state DNA repository other than as authorized by this part.
