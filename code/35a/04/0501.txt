(4) (a)  The provisions of Subsections (1), (2), and (3), to the extent that they relate to the unemployment trust fund, shall be operative only so long as the unemployment trust fund continues to exist and so long as the secretary of the treasury of the United States of America continues to maintain for the state a separate book account of all money deposited in the fund by the state for benefit purposes, together with the state's proportionate share of the earnings of the unemployment trust fund, from which no other state is permitted to make withdrawals.
