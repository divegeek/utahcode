(A)  "Judgment lien creditor" means a person who obtains a valid judgment of a court of record for recovery of specific property or a sum certain of money, and who in the case of a recovery of money, has a perfected lien under the judgment on the property involved.

(I)  the property is in existence and the interest has become protected under the law against a subsequent judgment lien arising out of an unsecured obligation; and

(II)  to the extent that, at that time, the holder has parted with money or money's worth.

(12) (a)  Except in cases involving a violation of unemployment compensation provisions under Section 76-8-1301, Subsection 35A-4-304(5), or Subsection 35A-4-405(5), and at the discretion of the division, the division may accept an offer in compromise from an employer or claimant to reduce past due debt arising from contributions or benefit overpayments imposed under this chapter.
