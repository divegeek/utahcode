(4) (a)  Whenever a person is not an employer under this chapter at the time it acquires the trade or business of an employer, the unemployment experience of the acquired business may not be transferred to that person if the division finds that the person acquired the business solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower rate of contributions.
