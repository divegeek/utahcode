(1)  The Legislature finds that:
(a)  it is in the public interest to fundamentally alter the state's cash
assistance program for needy families with children;
(b)  employment improves the quality of life for parents, children, and
individuals by increasing family income, developing job skills, and improving
self-esteem; and
(c)  the purpose of the cash assistance provided under this part is to assist
a parent client to obtain employment that is sufficient to sustain a family,
to ensure the dignity of those receiving assistance, and to strengthen
families.
(2)  The Legislature recognizes that even with assistance, some clients may be
unable to attain complete self-sufficiency.
