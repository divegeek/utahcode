(f)  appropriate public funds for an unlawful use or for a use that is not in compliance with contract provisions; or

(g)  knowingly or intentionally use public funds unlawfully or in violation of a governmental contract provision, or in violation of state policy.

(3)  A local mental health authority that knew or reasonably should have known of any of the circumstances described in Subsection (2), and that fails or refuses to take timely corrective action in good faith shall, in addition to any other penalties provided by law, be required to make full and complete repayment to the state of all public funds improperly used or expended.

(4)  Any public funds required to be repaid to the state by a local mental health authority pursuant to Subsection (3), based upon the actions or failure of the contract provider, may be recovered by the local mental health authority from its contract provider, in addition to the local mental health authority's costs and attorney's fees.
