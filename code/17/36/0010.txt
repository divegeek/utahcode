(1)  On or before the first day of the next to last month of every fiscal
period, the budget officer shall prepare for the next budget period and file
with the governing body a tentative budget for each fund for which a budget is
required.
(2)  The tentative budget shall set forth in tabular form:
(a)  actual revenues and expenditures in the last completed fiscal period;
(b)  estimated total revenues and expenditures for the current fiscal period;
(c)  the estimated available revenues and expenditures for the ensuing budget
period computed  by determining:
(i) the estimated expenditure for each fund after review of each departmental
budget request;
(ii) (A) the total revenue requirements of the fund;
(B)  the part of the total revenue that will be derived from revenue sources
other than property tax; and
(C)  the part of the total revenue that must be derived from property taxes;
(d)  if required by the governing body, actual performance experience to the
extent available in work units, unit costs, man hours, and man years for each
budgeted fund that includes an appropriation for salaries or wages for the
last completed fiscal period and the first eight months of the current fiscal
period if the county is on an annual fiscal period, or the first 20 months of
the current fiscal period if the county is on a biennial fiscal period,
together with the total estimated performance data of like character for the
current fiscal period and for the ensuing budget period.
(3)  The budget officer may recommend modification of any departmental budget
request under Subsection (2)(c)(i) before it is filed with the governing body,
if each department head has been given an opportunity to be heard concerning
the modification.
(4)  Each tentative budget shall contain the estimates of expenditures
submitted by any department together with specific work programs and other
supportive data as the governing body requests. The tentative budget shall be
accompanied by a supplementary estimate of all capital projects or planned
capital projects within the budget period and within the next three succeeding
years.
(5) (a)  Each tentative budget submitted in a county with a population in
excess of 25,000 determined pursuant to Section 17-36-4 shall be accompanied
by a budget message in explanation of the budget.
(b)  The budget message shall contain an outline of the proposed financial
policies of the county for the budget period and describe the important
features of the budgetary plan. It shall also state the reasons for changes
from the previous fiscal period in appropriation and revenue items and explain
any major changes in financial policy.
(c)  A budget message for counties with a population of less than 25,000 is
recommended but not incumbent upon the budget officer.
(6)  The tentative budget shall be reviewed, considered, and tentatively
adopted by the governing body in a regular or special meeting called for that
purpose. It may thereafter be amended or revised by the governing body prior
to public hearings thereon, except that no appropriation required for debt
retirement and interest or reduction, pursuant to Section 17-36-17, of any
deficits which exist may be reduced below the required minimum.
