If the taxable value of any existing county has been reduced below or raised
above the class and rank first assumed, the county legislative body of the
county shall designate the class to which the county has been reduced or
raised, and the county is in that class, and the salaries of county officers
shall be adjusted on or before January 1 next succeeding by the county
legislative body, but in no event may the salaries be reduced for the term for
which the officers were elected and are qualified. The county legislative body
in a newly created county shall at its first meeting after the organization of
the county, for the purpose of fixing salaries and compensation of county
officers, determine to which class the county belongs, and fix the salaries
for the first term of the officers accordingly.
