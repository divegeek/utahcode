auditor, unless a referendum approving that consolidation passes; or
(c)  consolidate the offices of county commissioner, county council member,
county executive, county assessor, or county auditor with the office of county

(3)  Each county legislative body shall ensure that any ordinance
consolidating or separating county offices:

elected; and
(b)  takes effect on the first Monday in January after the year in which

ordinance, in compliance with this Subsection (4) then in effect, separating
county offices that are prohibited from consolidation by this section, the
county legislative body may repeal that ordinance.
(ii)  If a county legislative body has published notice in a newspaper
identifying the county offices that will be filled in the November 2006
election, and that notice, because of a repeal of an ordinance under
Subsection (4)(b)(i), is incorrect, the county legislative body shall publish
notice once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county indicating
that the previous notice was incorrect and correctly identifying the county
offices that will be filled in the November 2006 election.
