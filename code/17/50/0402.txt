(1)  If the county executive finds that any claim presented is not payable by the county or is not a proper county charge, the county executive shall reject the claim.

(2) (a)  If the claim is found to be a proper county charge, but greater in amount than is justly due, the county executive may allow the claim in part and may order a warrant drawn for the portion allowed.

(b)  If the claimant is unwilling to receive the amount in full payment, the county executive may again consider the claim.
