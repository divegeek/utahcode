change in the form of county government, the county clerk shall send to the
county attorney of the county in which the optional plan is proposed or, if

would be violated by implementation of the optional plan as prepared by the
study committee;
(ii)  identify specifically each provision or feature of the proposed optional
plan that would result in a statutory or constitutional violation if the plan
is implemented as prepared by the study committee;
(iii)  state whether, in the attorney's opinion, any of the provisions or
features identified in Subsection (3)(b)(ii) are so integral to the proposed
optional plan that having previously changed the specified provision or
feature to avoid the violation would have affected the decision of a study
committee member who favored the proposed optional plan; and
(iv)  if all the provisions or features identified in Subsection (3)(b)(ii) do
not meet the standard of Subsection (3)(b)(iii), recommend how the proposed
optional plan may be modified to avoid the statutory or constitutional

report under that subsection.
(b)  If the attorney's statement under Subsection (3) identifies provisions or
features under Subsection (3)(b)(ii) that do not meet the standard of
Subsection (3)(b)(iii), the optional plan may be modified by the study
committee to avoid the statutory or constitutional violations and then be the
subject of a resolution or petition under Subsection 17-52-206(1).
(5)  If the attorney's statement under Subsection (3) does not identify any
provisions or features of the proposed optional plan that, if implemented,
