(2)  The recorder shall alphabetically arrange the indexes required by this
section and keep a reverse index.

it shows a true chain of title to each tract or parcel, together with each
encumbrance on the tract or parcel, according to the records of the office.
(b)  A recorder shall abstract an instrument in the tract index unless:
(i)  the instrument is required to contain a legal description under Section
17-21-20 and does not contain that legal description; or
(ii)  the instrument contains errors, omissions, or defects to the extent that
the tract or parcel to which the instrument relates cannot be determined.

required by this section, the recorder may:

damages suffered as a result of information contained in an instrument
recorded in a tract index or other index that is required by this section
despite errors, omissions, or defects in the instrument.

included in the tract index does not cure a failure to give public notice
caused by an error, omission, or defect.
(g)  A document that is indexed in all or part of the indexes required by this
section shall give constructive notice.
(4)  Nothing in this section prevents the recorder from using a single name
