(b)  A recorder shall abstract an instrument in the tract index unless:

(i)  the instrument is required to contain a legal description under Section 17-21-20 or Section 57-3-105 and does not contain that legal description; or

(ii)  the instrument contains errors, omissions, or defects to the extent that the tract or parcel to which the instrument relates cannot be determined.

(g)  A document that is indexed in all or part of the indexes required by this section shall give constructive notice.

(4)  Nothing in this section prevents the recorder from using a single name index if that index includes all of the indexes required by this section.
