(b)  If a petition is filed under Subsection (1)(a), the land use authority shall hold a public hearing within 45 days after the day on which the petition is filed if:

(i)  any owner within the plat notifies the county of the owner's objection in writing within 10 days of mailed notification; or

(2) Unless a local ordinance provides otherwise, the public hearing requirement of Subsection (1)(b) does not apply and a land use authority may consider at a public meeting an owner's petition to vacate or amend a subdivision plat if:

(a)  the petition seeks to:

(i)  join two or more of the petitioning fee owner's contiguous lots;

(ii)  subdivide one or more of the petitioning fee owner's lots, if the subdivision will not result in a violation of a land use ordinance or a development condition;

(iv)  on a lot owned by the petitioning fee owner, adjust an internal lot restriction imposed by the local political subdivision; or

(v)  alter the plat in a manner that does not change existing boundaries or other attributes of lots within the subdivision that are not:

(B)  designated as a common area; and

(b)  notice has been given to adjacent property owners in accordance with any applicable local ordinance.

(3)  Each request to vacate or amend a plat that contains a request to vacate or amend a public street, right-of-way, or easement is also subject to Section 17-27a-609.5.

(b)  the signature of each owner who consents to the petition.

(5) (a)  The owners of record of adjacent parcels that are described by either a metes and bounds description or by a recorded plat may exchange title to portions of those parcels if the exchange of title is approved by the land use authority in accordance with Subsection (5)(b).

(ii)  a document of conveyance of title reflecting the approved change shall be recorded in the office of the county recorder.
