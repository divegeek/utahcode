(b)  an individual, while acting or purporting to act on behalf of the state or a political subdivision of the state, may not confiscate a privately owned firearm of another individual.

(3)  A law or regulation passed during a declared state of emergency that does not relate specifically to the lawful possession or use of a firearm and that has attached criminal penalties may not be used to justify the confiscation of a firearm from an individual acting in defense of self, property, or others when on:

(a)  the individual's private property; or

(b)  the private property of another as an invitee.

(4) (a)  An individual who has a firearm confiscated in violation of Subsection (2) may bring a civil action in a court having the appropriate jurisdiction:

(5) (a)  A law enforcement officer is not subject to disciplinary action for refusing to confiscate a firearm under this section if:

(i)  ordered or directed to do so by a superior officer; and

(ii)  by obeying the order or direction, the law enforcement officer would be committing a violation of this section.

(b)  For purposes of this Subsection (5), disciplinary action might include:

(6) (a)  If a law enforcement officer commits a violation of this section, the officer's liability in an action brought under Subsection (4)(a) is limited to 5% of the damages and civil penalty allowed under Subsection (4)(a) if the officer can show by clear and convincing evidence that the officer was obeying a direct and unlawful order from a superior officer or authority.

(b)  The court shall assess the balance of the damages and civil penalty, the remaining 95%, against the superior officer or authority who ordered or directed the confiscation in violation of this section.
