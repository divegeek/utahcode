(1)  On a continuing basis the governor may obtain all necessary information
from energy resource producers, manufacturers, suppliers, and consumers doing
business within, and from political subdivisions in, this state as necessary
to determine whether shortages or an emergency will require energy resource
conservation measures.  This information may include, but shall not be limited
to:
(a)  sales volumes;
(b)  forecasts of energy resource requirements;
(c)  from manufacturers, suppliers, and consumers, an inventory of energy
resources; and
(d)  local distribution patterns of the information described in Subsections
(1)(a), (1)(b), and (1)(c).
(2)  In obtaining information at any time from energy resource producers,
manufacturers, suppliers, or consumers under Subsection (1)(c) and in
obtaining any other information under Subsection (1) during a state of
emergency proclaimed, the governor may subpoena witnesses, material and
relevant books, papers, accounts, records, and memoranda, administer oaths,
and cause the depositions of persons residing within or without the state to
be taken in the manner prescribed for depositions in civil actions in district
courts, to obtain information relevant to energy resources that are the
subject of the proclaimed emergency.
(3)  In obtaining information under this section the governor shall:
(a)  seek to avoid eliciting information already furnished by a person or
political subdivision in this state to a federal, state, or local regulatory
authority that is available for the governor's study; and
(b)  cause reporting procedures, including forms, to conform to existing
requirements of federal, state, and local regulatory authorities wherever
possible.
