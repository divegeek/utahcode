(ii)  The minor shall then be released to the care of the minor's parent or other responsible adult, unless the minor's immediate welfare or the protection of the community requires the minor's detention.

(5) (a)  The person who takes a minor to a detention or shelter facility shall promptly file with the detention or shelter facility a written report on a form provided by the division stating the details of the presently alleged offense, the facts which bring the minor within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, and the reason the minor was not released by law enforcement.

The designated persons may receive the information for purposes of the minor's supervision and student safety.

(iii)  Any employee of the local law enforcement agency and the school which the minor attends who discloses the notification of home detention is not:
