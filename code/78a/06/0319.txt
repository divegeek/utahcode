(1)  With regard to a child who is the subject of a petition under this
chapter based on educational neglect:
(a)  if allegations include failure of a child to make adequate educational
progress, the court shall permit demonstration of the child's educational
skills and abilities based upon any of the criteria used in granting school
credit, in accordance with Section 53A-11-102.5;
(b)  parental refusal to comply with actions taken by school authorities in
violation of Sections 53A-13-101.1, 53A-13-101.2, or 53A-13-101.3, does not
constitute educational neglect;
(c)  parental refusal to support efforts by a school to encourage a child to
act in accordance with any educational objective that focuses on the adoption
or expression of a personal philosophy, attitude, or belief that is not
reasonably necessary to maintain order and discipline in the school, prevent
unreasonable endangerment of persons or property, or to maintain concepts of
civility and propriety appropriate to a school setting, does not constitute
educational neglect; and
(d)  an allegation of educational neglect may not be sustained, based solely
on a child's absence from school, unless the child has been absent from school
or from any given class, without good cause, for more than 10 consecutive
school days or more than 1/16 of the applicable school term.
(2)  A child may not be considered to be educationally neglected, for purposes
of this chapter:

officials have complied with the requirements of Section 53A-11-103; and
(ii)  the child is two or more years behind the local public school's age
group expectations in one or more basic skills, and is not receiving special
educational services or systematic remediation efforts designed to correct the
problem;

evidence that:
(i)  school authorities have failed to comply with the requirements of Title
53A, Chapter 11 or 13;
(ii)  the child is being instructed at home in compliance with Section
53A-11-102;

exempt under other applicable state or federal law;
(vii)  the student has performed above the twenty-fifth percentile of the
local public school's age group expectations in all basic skills, as measured
by a standardized academic achievement test administered by the school
district where the student resides; or
(viii)  the parent or guardian has proffered a reasonable alternative to
required school curriculum, in accordance with Section 53A-13-101.2, that
alternative was rejected by the school district, but the parents have
implemented the alternative curriculum; or
