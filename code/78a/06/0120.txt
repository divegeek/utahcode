78A-6-120.    Continuing jurisdiction of juvenile court -- Period of and
termination of jurisdiction -- Notice of discharge from custody of local
mental health authority or Utah State Developmental Center -- Transfer of
continuing jurisdiction to other district.
(1)  Jurisdiction of a minor obtained by the court through adjudication under
Section 78A-6-117 continues for purposes of this chapter until he becomes 21
years of age, unless terminated earlier.  However, the court, subject to
Section 78A-6-121, retains jurisdiction beyond the age of 21 of a person who
has refused or failed to pay any fine or victim restitution ordered by the
court, but only for the purpose of causing compliance with existing orders.
(2) (a)  The continuing jurisdiction of the court terminates:
(i)  upon order of the court;
(ii)  upon commitment to a secure youth corrections facility; or
(iii)  upon commencement of proceedings in adult cases under Section
78A-6-1001.
(b)  The continuing jurisdiction of the court is not terminated by marriage.
(3)  When a minor has been committed by the court to the physical custody of a
local mental health authority or its designee or to the Utah State
Developmental Center, the local mental health authority or its designee or the
superintendent of the Utah State Developmental Center shall give the court
written notice of its intention to discharge, release, or parole the minor not
fewer than five days prior to the discharge, release, or parole.
(4)  Jurisdiction over a minor on probation or under protective supervision,
or of a minor who is otherwise under the continuing jurisdiction of the court,
may be transferred by the court to the court of another district, if the
receiving court consents, or upon direction of the chair of the Board of
Juvenile Court Judges.  The receiving court has the same powers with respect
to the minor that it would have if the proceedings originated in that court.
