78A-6-701.   Jurisdiction of district court.

(1)  The district court has exclusive original jurisdiction over all persons 16 years of age or older charged with:

(a)  an offense which would be murder or aggravated murder if committed by an adult; or

(b)  an offense which would be a felony if committed by an adult if the minor has been previously committed to a secure facility as defined in Section 62A-7-101.  This Subsection (1)(b) shall not apply if the offense is committed in a secure facility.

(2)  When the district court has exclusive original jurisdiction over a minor under this section, it also has exclusive original jurisdiction over the minor regarding all offenses joined with the qualifying offense, and any other offenses, including misdemeanors, arising from the same criminal episode.  The district court is not divested of jurisdiction by virtue of the fact that the minor is allowed to enter a plea to, or is found guilty of, a lesser or joined offense.

(3) (a)  Any felony, misdemeanor, or infraction committed after the offense over which the district court takes jurisdiction under Subsection (1) or (2) shall be tried against the defendant as an adult in the district court or justice court having jurisdiction.

(b)  If the qualifying charge under Subsection (1) results in an acquittal, a finding of not guilty, or a dismissal of the charge in the district court, the juvenile court under Section 78A-6-103 and the Division of Juvenile Justice Services regain any jurisdiction and authority previously exercised over the minor.
