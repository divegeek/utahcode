(9) (a)  If the child is in the protective custody of the division, the court shall order that the child be released from the protective custody of the division unless it finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that any one of the following exist:

(i)  subject to Subsection (9)(b)(i), there is a substantial danger to the physical health or safety of the child and the child's physical health or safety may not be protected without removing the child from the custody of the child's parent;

(ii) (A)  the child is suffering emotional damage; and

(B)  there are no reasonable means available by which the child's emotional health may be protected without removing the child from the custody of the child's parent;

(iii)  there is a substantial risk that the child will suffer abuse or neglect if the child is not removed from the custody of the child's parents;

(iv)  subject to Subsection (9)(b)(ii), the child or a minor residing in the same household has been, or is considered to be at substantial risk of being, physically abused, sexually abused, or sexually exploited by a:

(A)  parent;

(B)  member of the parent's household; or

(C)  person known to the parent;

(v)  the parent is unwilling to have physical custody of the child;

(vi)  the child is without any provision for the child's support;

(vii)  a parent who is incarcerated or institutionalized has not or cannot arrange for safe and appropriate care for the child;

(viii) (A)  a relative or other adult custodian with whom the child is left by the parent is unwilling or unable to provide care or support for the child;

(B)  the whereabouts of the parent are unknown; and

(C)  reasonable efforts to locate the parent are unsuccessful;

(ix)  the child is in urgent need of medical care;

(x)  the physical environment or the fact that the child is left unattended beyond a reasonable period of time poses a threat to the child's health or safety;

(xi)  the child or a minor residing in the same household has been neglected;

(xiii)  the child's welfare is substantially endangered.

(b) (i)  Prima facie evidence of the finding described in Subsection (9)(a)(i) is established if:

(A)  a court previously adjudicated that the child suffered abuse, neglect, or dependency involving the parent; and

(B)  a subsequent incident of abuse, neglect, or dependency involving the parent occurs.

(ii)  For purposes of Subsection (9)(a)(iv), if the court finds that the parent knowingly allowed the child to be in the physical care of a person after the parent received actual notice that the person physically abused, sexually abused, or sexually exploited the child, that fact constitutes prima facie evidence that there is a substantial risk that the child will be physically abused, sexually abused, or sexually exploited.

(10) (a) (i)  The court shall also make a determination on the record as to whether reasonable efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from the child's home and whether there are available services that would prevent the need for continued removal.

(ii)  If the court finds that the child can be safely returned to the custody of the child's parent or guardian through the provision of those services, the court shall place the child with the child's parent or guardian and order that those services be provided by the division.

(b)  In making the determination described in Subsection (10)(a), and in ordering and providing services, the child's health, safety, and welfare shall be the paramount concern, in accordance with federal law.

(11)  Where the division's first contact with the family occurred during an emergency situation in which the child could not safely remain at home, the court shall make a finding that any lack of preplacement preventive efforts was appropriate.

(12)  In cases where actual sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, abandonment, severe abuse, or severe neglect are involved, neither the division nor the court has any duty to make "reasonable efforts" or to, in any other way, attempt to maintain a child in the child's home, return a child to the child's home, provide reunification services, or attempt to rehabilitate the offending parent or parents.

(13)  The court may not order continued removal of a child solely on the basis of educational neglect as described in Subsection 78A-6-105(25)(b) truancy, or failure to comply with a court order to attend school.

(14) (a)  Whenever a court orders continued removal of a child under this section, the court shall state the facts on which that decision is based.

(b)  If no continued removal is ordered and the child is returned home, the court shall state the facts on which that decision is based.

(15)  If the court finds that continued removal and temporary custody are necessary for the protection of a child because harm may result to the child if the child were returned home, the court shall order continued removal regardless of:

(a)  any error in the initial removal of the child;

(b)  the failure of a party to comply with notice provisions; or

(c)  any other procedural requirement of this chapter or Title 62A, Chapter 4a, Child and Family Services.
