78A-6-302.   Court-ordered protective custody of a child following petition
filing -- Grounds.
(1)  After a petition has been filed under Section 78A-6-304, if the child who
is the subject of the petition is not in the protective custody of the
division, a court may order that the child be removed from the child's home or
otherwise taken into protective custody if the court finds, by a preponderance
of the evidence, that any one or more of the following circumstances exist:
(a) (i)  there is an imminent danger to the physical health or safety of the
child; and
(ii)  the child's physical health or safety may not be protected without
removing the child from the custody of the child's parent or guardian;
(b) (i)  a parent or guardian engages in or threatens the child with
unreasonable conduct that causes the child to suffer emotional damage; and
(ii)  there are no reasonable means available by which the child's emotional
health may be protected without removing the child from the custody of the
child's parent or guardian;
(c)  the child or another child residing in the same household has been, or is
considered to be at substantial risk of being, physically abused, sexually
abused, or sexually exploited, by a parent or guardian, a member of the
parent's or guardian's household, or other person known to the parent or
guardian;
(d)  the parent or guardian is unwilling to have physical custody of the
child;
(e)  the child is abandoned or left without any provision for the child's
support;
(f)  a parent or guardian who has been incarcerated or institutionalized has
not arranged or cannot arrange for safe and appropriate care for the child;
(g) (i)  a relative or other adult custodian with whom the child is left by
the parent or guardian is unwilling or unable to provide care or support for
the child;
(ii)  the whereabouts of the parent or guardian are unknown; and
(iii)  reasonable efforts to locate the parent or guardian are unsuccessful;
(h)  the child is in immediate need of medical care;
(i) (i)  a parent's or guardian's actions, omissions, or habitual action
create an environment that poses a threat to the child's health or safety; or
(ii)  a parent's or guardian's action in leaving a child unattended would
reasonably pose a threat to the child's health or safety;
(j)  the child or another child residing in the same household has been
neglected;
(k)  an infant has been abandoned, as defined in Section 78A-6-316;
(l) (i)  the parent or guardian, or an adult residing in the same household as
the parent or guardian, is charged or arrested pursuant to Title 58, Chapter
37d, Clandestine Drug Lab Act; and
(ii)  any clandestine laboratory operation was located in the residence or on
the property where the child resided; or
(m)  the child's welfare is otherwise endangered.
(2) (a)  For purposes of Subsection (1)(a), if a child has previously been
adjudicated as abused, neglected, or dependent, and a subsequent incident of
abuse, neglect, or dependency occurs involving the same substantiated abuser
or under similar circumstance as the previous abuse, that fact constitutes
prima facie evidence that the child cannot safely remain in the custody of the
child's parent.
(b)  For purposes of Subsection (1)(c):
(i)  another child residing in the same household may not be removed from the
home unless that child is considered to be at substantial risk of being
physically abused, sexually abused, or sexually exploited as described in
Subsection (1)(c) or Subsection (2)(b)(ii); and
(ii)  if a parent or guardian has received actual notice that physical abuse,
sexual abuse, or sexual exploitation by a person known to the parent has
occurred, and there is evidence that the parent or guardian failed to protect
the child, after having received the notice, by allowing the child to be in
the physical presence of the alleged abuser, that fact constitutes prima facie
evidence that the child is at substantial risk of being physically abused,
sexually abused, or sexually exploited.
(3)  In the absence of one of the factors described in Subsection (1), a court
may not remove a child from the parent's or guardian's custody on the basis
of:
(a)  educational neglect;
(b)  mental illness or poverty of the parent or guardian; or
(c)  disability of the parent or guardian, as defined in Section 57-21-2.
(4)  A child removed from the custody of the child's parent or guardian under
this section may not be placed or kept in a secure detention facility pending
further court proceedings unless the child is detainable based on guidelines
promulgated by the Division of Juvenile Justice Services.
(5)  This section does not preclude removal of a child from the child's home
without a warrant or court order under Section 62A-4a-202.1.
(6) (a)  Except as provided in Subsection (6)(b), a court or the Division of
Child and Family Services may not remove a child from the custody of the
child's parent or guardian on the sole or primary basis that the parent or
guardian refuses to consent to:
(i)  the administration of a psychotropic medication to a child;
(ii)  a psychiatric, psychological, or behavioral treatment for a child; or
(iii)  a psychiatric or behavioral health evaluation of a child.
(b)  Notwithstanding Subsection (6)(a), a court or the Division of Child and
Family Services may remove a child under conditions that would otherwise be
prohibited under Subsection (6)(a) if failure to take an action described
under Subsection (6)(a) would present a serious, imminent risk to the child's
physical safety or the physical safety of others.
