member" as defined by that statute.
(2) (a)  At the shelter hearing, when the court orders that a child be removed
from the custody of the child's parent in accordance with the requirements of
Section 78A-6-306, the court shall first determine whether there is another
natural parent with whom the child was not residing at the time the events or
conditions that brought the child within the court's jurisdiction occurred,
who desires to assume custody of the child.
(b)  If another natural parent requests custody under Subsection (2)(a), the

placement would be unsafe or otherwise detrimental to the child.
(c)  The provisions of this Subsection (2) are limited by the provisions of
Subsection (18)(b).

parent described in Subsection (2)(b) to assume custody, and the safety and
appropriateness of the placement.

regarding the safety and appropriateness of the placement.

reunification efforts, apply to children placed with a previously noncustodial
parent in accordance with Subsection (2).

Subsection (2) or (3).  In order to affect a previous court order regarding
legal custody, the party must petition that court for modification of the
order.
(7)  If, at the time of the shelter hearing, a child is removed from the

through (e), there is a relative of the child or a friend of a parent of the
child who is able and willing to care for the child;
(b)  may order the division to conduct a reasonable search to determine
whether, subject to Subsections (18)(c) through (e), there are relatives of

(i)  conduct a criminal background check of the relative that complies with
the criminal background check provisions described in Section 78A-6-308; and

under Section 62A-2-120, the division shall:
(A)  take the child into physical custody; and
(B)  within three days, excluding weekends and holidays, after taking the

relative, or friend under this section, the court shall order that the child
be placed in the temporary custody of the Division of Child and Family
Services, to proceed to adjudication and disposition and to be provided with
care and services in accordance with this chapter and Title 62A, Chapter 4a,
Child and Family Services.
(18) (a)  Any preferential consideration that a relative or friend is
initially granted pursuant to Subsection (9) expires 120 days from the date of
the shelter hearing.  After that time period has expired, a relative or friend
who has not obtained custody or asserted an interest in a child, may not be
granted preferential consideration by the division or the court.
(b)  When the time period described in Subsection (18)(a) has expired, the
preferential consideration which is initially granted to a natural parent in
accordance with Subsection (2), is limited.  After that time the court shall
base its custody decision on the best interest of the child.
(c)  Prior to the expiration of the 120-day period described in Subsection
(18)(a), the following order of preference shall be applied when determining
the person with whom a child will be placed, provided that the person is
willing, and has the ability, to care for the child:
(i)  a noncustodial parent of the child;
(ii)  a relative of the child;
(iii)  subject to Subsection (18)(d), a friend of a parent of the child, if
the friend is a licensed foster parent; and
(iv)  other placements that are consistent with the requirements of law.
(d)  In determining whether a friend is a willing and appropriate placement
for a child, neither the court, nor the division, is required to consider more
than one friend designated by each parent of the child.
(e)  If a parent of the child is not able to designate a friend who is a
licensed foster parent for placement of the child, but is able to identify a
friend who is willing to become licensed as a foster parent:
(i)  the department shall fully cooperate to expedite the licensing process
for the friend; and
(ii)  if the friend becomes licensed as a foster parent within the time frame
described in Subsection (18)(a), the court shall determine whether it is in
the best interests of the child to place the child with the friend.
(19)  If, following the shelter hearing, the child is placed with a person who
is not a parent of the child, a relative of the child, a friend of a parent of
the child, or a former foster parent of the child, priority shall be given to
a foster placement with a man and a woman who are married to each other,
unless it is in the best interests of the child to place the child with a
single foster parent.
(20)  In determining the placement of a child, neither the court, nor the
division, may take into account, or discriminate against, the religion of a
person with whom the child may be placed, unless the purpose of taking
religion into account is to place the child with a person or family of the
same religion as the child.
