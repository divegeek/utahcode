(2) (a)  At the shelter hearing, when the court orders that a child be removed from the custody of the child's parent in accordance with the requirements of Section 78A-6-306, the court shall first determine whether there is another natural parent with whom the child was not residing at the time the events or conditions that brought the child within the court's jurisdiction occurred, who desires to assume custody of the child.

(c)  the court shall order reasonable parent-time with the parent from whose custody the child was removed, unless parent-time is not in the best interest of the child.

(7)  If, at the time of the shelter hearing, a child is removed from the custody of the child's parent and is not placed in the custody of the child's other parent, the court:

(17)  When the court orders that a child be removed from the custody of the child's parent and does not award custody and guardianship to another parent, relative, or friend under this section, the court shall order that the child be placed in the temporary custody of the Division of Child and Family Services, to proceed to adjudication and disposition and to be provided with care and services in accordance with this chapter and Title 62A, Chapter 4a, Child and Family Services.

(i)  the department shall fully cooperate to expedite the licensing process for the friend; and

(ii)  if the friend becomes licensed as a foster parent within the time frame described in Subsection (18)(a), the court shall determine whether it is in the best interests of the child to place the child with the friend.

(19)  If, following the shelter hearing, the child is placed with a person who is not a parent of the child, a relative of the child, a friend of a parent of the child, or a former foster parent of the child, priority shall be given to a foster placement with a man and a woman who are married to each other, unless it is in the best interests of the child to place the child with a single foster parent.
