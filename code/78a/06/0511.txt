(b)  may order the division to conduct a reasonable search to determine whether there are relatives who are willing to adopt the child; and

(c)  shall, if a relative desires to adopt the child:

(i)  make a specific finding regarding the fitness of the relative to adopt the child; and

(ii)  place the child for adoption with that relative unless it finds that adoption by the relative is not in the best interest of the child.
