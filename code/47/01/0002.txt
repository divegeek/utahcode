47-1-2.   Injunction -- Notice to owner of premises.
Whenever a nuisance as defined in this chapter is kept or maintained, or
exists, the county attorney or any citizen of the county may maintain an
action in equity in the name of the state of Utah, upon the relation of such
county attorney or citizen, to perpetually enjoin such nuisance, the person or
persons conducting or maintaining the same and the owner or agent of the
building or ground upon which it exists; provided, that when the owner or
agent is not in the actual possession of the premises he shall have, before an
action is brought under this chapter against him or affecting his real estate,
notice in writing of the existence and nature of the nuisance, and he shall
have a reasonable time after service of such notice in which to abate the
nuisance. In such action the court, or a judge thereof, shall upon the
presentation of a complaint therefor alleging that the nuisance complained of
exists, allow a temporary writ of injunction without bond, if it shall be made
to appear to the satisfaction of the court or judge that such nuisance exists,
by evidence in the form of affidavits, depositions, oral testimony or
otherwise, as the complainant may elect, unless the court or judge, by
previous order, shall have directed the form and manner in which it shall be
presented. Three days' notice in writing shall be given the defendant of the
hearing of the application, and if then continued at his instance, the writ as
prayed for shall be granted as a matter of course. When an injunction has been
granted it shall be binding on the defendant throughout the judicial district
in which it was issued, and any violation of the provisions of the injunction
herein provided for shall be a contempt as hereinafter provided.
