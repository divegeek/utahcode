12-1-2.   Amount of bond -- Conditions -- Right of action.
(1)  The bond shall be for the sum of $10,000, payable to the state of Utah.
(2)  The bond shall provide that the person giving  it shall, upon written
demand, remit the collection proceeds to or for the person for whom any
account, bill, or other indebtedness is taken for collection in accordance
with the collection agreement. The Division of Corporations and Commercial
Code may specify the form of the bond and may require it to contain additional
provisions and conditions it considers necessary or proper to protect the
persons for whom the collection is undertaken.
(3)  If a bond becomes forfeited or the sureties for it become liable upon it,
any person injured by the acts of forfeiture or by the acts resulting in the
sureties' liability, or who by law is entitled to the benefit of the security,
may maintain an action on the bond in his own name against the person giving
the bond and against the sureties to recover the amount of the bond to which
he may be entitled. One recovery does not bar recoveries for other breaches of
the bond so long as the sureties are liable in the aggregate only to the
extent of the undertaking.
