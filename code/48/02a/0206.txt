amendment or cancellation, shall be delivered to the division.  A person who
executes a certificate as an attorney-in-fact or fiduciary need not exhibit

(a)  place on the original and the copy a stamp or seal indicating the time,
day, month, and year of the filing, the director of the division's signature,
and the division's seal, or facsimiles thereof, and the name of the division;
(b)  file the signed original in its office; and
(c)  return the stamped copy to the person who filed it or the person’s
representative.
(2)  The stamped copy of the certificate of limited partnership and of any
certificate of amendment or cancellation shall be conclusive evidence that all
conditions precedent required for the formation, amendment, or cancellation of
a limited partnership have been complied with and the limited partnership has
been formed, amended, or canceled under this chapter, except with respect to
an action for involuntary cancellation of the limited partnership's
certificate for fraud under Subsection 48-2a-203.5(1)(a).
(3)  Upon the filing of a certificate of amendment or judicial decree of
amendment with the division, the certificate of limited partnership is amended
as set forth in the certificate of amendment or judicial decree of amendment,
and upon filing a certificate of cancellation, or of a judicial decree of
cancellation, the division shall cancel the certificate of limited partnership
effective as of the date the cancellation was filed or as of the date
specified in the decree, unless a later effective date is specified in the
