(1)  Except as provided in Subsection (4), a limited partner is not liable for
the obligations of a limited partnership unless he is also a general partner
or, in addition to the exercise of his rights and powers as a limited partner,
he participates in the control of the business.  However, if the limited
partner participates in the control of the business, he is liable only to
persons who transact business with the limited partnership reasonably
believing, based upon the limited partner's conduct, that the limited partner
is a general partner.

within the meaning of Subsection (1) solely by doing one or more of the
following:
(a)  being a contractor for or an agent or employee of the limited partnership
or of a general partner, or being an officer, director, or shareholder of a
general partner that is a corporation;
(b)  consulting with and advising a general partner with respect to the
business of the limited partnership;
(c)  acting as surety for the limited partnership or guaranteeing or assuming
one or more specific obligations of the limited partnership;

derivative action in the right of the limited partnership;

more of the following matters:
(i)  the dissolution and winding up of the limited partnership;

substantially all of the assets of the limited partnership;

the ordinary course of its business;

(vi)  the admission or removal of a limited partner;
(vii)  a transaction involving an actual or potential conflict of interest
between a general partner and the limited partnership or the limited partners;
(viii)  an amendment to the partnership agreement or certificate of limited
partnership; or
(ix)  matters related to the business of the limited partnership not otherwise
enumerated in this subsection, which the partnership agreement states in
writing may be subject to the approval or disapproval of limited partners;
(g)  winding up the limited partnership pursuant to Section 48-2a-803; or
(h)  exercising any right or power permitted limited partners under this
chapter and not specifically enumerated in this subsection.
(3)  The enumeration in Subsection (2) does not mean that the possession or
exercise of any other powers by a limited partner constitutes participation by
him in the business of the limited partnership.
(4)  A limited partner who knowingly permits his name to be used in the name
of the limited partnership, except under circumstances permitted by Subsection
48-2a-102(1)(b) is liable to creditors who extend credit to the limited
partnership without actual knowledge that the limited partner is not a general
partner.
