(b)  consulting with and advising a general partner with respect to the business of the limited partnership;

(c)  acting as surety for the limited partnership or guaranteeing or assuming one or more specific obligations of the limited partnership;

(i)  the dissolution and winding up of the limited partnership;

(g)  winding up the limited partnership pursuant to Section 48-2a-803; or

(h)  exercising any right or power permitted limited partners under this chapter and not specifically enumerated in this subsection.

(3)  The enumeration in Subsection (2) does not mean that the possession or exercise of any other powers by a limited partner constitutes participation by him in the business of the limited partnership.

(4)  A limited partner who knowingly permits his name to be used in the name of the limited partnership, except under circumstances permitted by Subsection 48-2a-102(1)(b) is liable to creditors who extend credit to the limited partnership without actual knowledge that the limited partner is not a general partner.
