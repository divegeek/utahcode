48-2a-702.   Assignment of partnership interest.

Except as provided in the partnership agreement, a partnership interest is assignable in whole or in part.   Except as set forth in Subsection 48-2a-801(4), an assignment of a partnership interest does not dissolve a limited partnership or entitle the assignee to become or to exercise any rights of a partner.  An assignment entitles the assignee to receive, to the extent assigned, only the distribution to which the assignor would be entitled. Except as provided in the partnership agreement, a partner ceases to be a partner upon assignment of all of his partnership interest.
