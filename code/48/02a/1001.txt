48-2a-1001.   Right of action.
A limited partner may bring an action in the right of a limited partnership to
recover a judgment in its favor if general partners with authority to do so
have refused to bring the action and the general partners' decision not to sue
constitutes an abuse of discretion or involves a conflict of interest that
prevents an unprejudiced exercise of judgment, or if an effort to cause those
general partners to bring the action is not likely to succeed.
