(2)  To have its statement of qualification reinstated, a partnership whose statement of qualification has been revoked administratively must pay all fees, taxes, and penalties that were due to the division at the time of the administrative revocation and all fees, taxes, and penalties that would have been due to the division while the partnership's statement of qualification was revoked administratively.

(3)  If the division determines that the application contains the information required by Subsection (1), is satisfied that the information is correct, and determines that all payments required to be made to the division by Subsection (2) have been made, the division shall:

(a)  cancel the statement of revocation and prepare a statement of reinstatement that states the division's determination and the effective date of reinstatement;

(b)  file the statement of revocation; and

(c)  serve a copy of the statement of revocation on the limited liability partnership.

(4)  When reinstatement under this section is effective, the following rules apply:

(a)  the reinstatement relates back to and takes effect as of the effective date of the administrative revocation; and

(b)  the partnership's status as a limited liability partnership continues as if the revocation had not occurred, except for the rights of a person arising out of an act or omission in reliance on the revocation before the person knew or had notice of the reinstatement are not affected.
