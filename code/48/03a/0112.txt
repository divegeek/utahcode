(a)  The operating agreement may specify the method by which a specific act or transaction that would otherwise violate the duty of loyalty may be authorized or ratified by one or more disinterested and independent persons after full disclosure of all material facts.

(b)  To the extent the operating agreement of a member-managed limited liability company expressly relieves a member of a responsibility that the member would otherwise have under this chapter and imposes the responsibility on one or more other members, the operating agreement may, to the benefit of the member that the operating agreement relieves of the responsibility, also eliminate or limit any fiduciary duty that would have pertained to the responsibility.

(5)  The court shall decide as a matter of law whether a term of an operating agreement is unconscionable or against public policy under Subsection (3)(f) or (4)(c).  The court:

(a)  shall make its determination as of the time the challenged term became part of the operating agreement and by considering only circumstances existing at that time; and

(b)  may invalidate the term only if, in light of the purposes, activities, and affairs of the limited liability company, it is readily apparent that:

(i)  the objective of the term is unconscionable or against public policy; or

(ii)  the means to achieve the term's objective is unconscionable or against public policy.
