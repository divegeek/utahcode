48-1-24.   Assignment of partner's interest.
A conveyance by a partner of his interest in the partnership does not of
itself dissolve the partnership, or, as against the other partners in the
absence of agreement, entitle the assignee during the continuance of the
partnership to interfere in the management or administration of the
partnership business or affairs, or to require any information or account of
partnership transactions, or to inspect the partnership books; but it merely
entitles the assignee to receive in accordance with his contract the profits
to which the assigning partner would otherwise be entitled.
In case of a dissolution of a partnership, the assignee is entitled to receive
his assignor's interest, and may require an account from the date only of the
last account agreed to by all the partners.
