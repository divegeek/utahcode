48-1-15.   Rules determining rights and duties of partners.
The rights and duties of the partners in relation to the partnership shall be
determined, subject to any agreement between them, by the following rules:
(1)  Each partner shall be repaid his contributions, whether by way of capital
or advances to the partnership property, and share equally in the profits and
surplus remaining after all liabilities, including those to partners, are
satisfied; and, except as provided in Subsection 48-1-12(2), must contribute
towards the losses, whether of capital or otherwise, sustained by the
partnership according to his share in the profits.
(2)  The partnership must indemnify every partner in respect of payments made
and personal liabilities reasonably incurred by him in the ordinary and proper
conduct of its business, or for the preservation of its business or property.
(3)  A partner who in aid of the partnership makes any payment or advance
beyond the amount of capital which he agreed to contribute shall be paid
interest from the date of the payment or advance.
(4)  A partner shall receive interest on the capital contributed by him only
from the date when repayment should be made.
(5)  All partners have equal rights in the management and conduct of the
partnership business.
(6)  No partner is entitled to remuneration for acting in the partnership
business, except that a surviving partner is entitled to reasonable
compensation for his services in winding up the partnership affairs.
(7)  No person can become a member of a partnership without the consent of all
the partners.
(8)  Any difference arising as to ordinary matters connected with the
partnership business may be decided by a majority of the partners; but no act
in contravention of any agreement between the partners may be done rightfully
without the consent of all the partners.
