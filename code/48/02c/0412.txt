(3)  Notwithstanding Subsection (1), if a low-profit limited liability company produces significant income or capital appreciation, in the absence of other factors, the fact that the low-profit limited liability company produces significant income or capital appreciation is not conclusive evidence of a significant purpose involving the production of income or the appreciation of property.
