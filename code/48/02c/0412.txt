(iii)  be organized for a business purpose that satisfies, and at all times operates to satisfy each of the requirements under Subsection (1)(b).

(b)  A low-profit limited liability company:

(i)  shall significantly further the accomplishment of one or more charitable or educational purposes within the meaning of Section 170(c)(2)(B), Internal Revenue Code;
