An operating agreement may be entered into before, at the time of, or after
the filing of the articles of organization.  Regardless of the timing, the
agreement may, by its own terms, be effective upon formation of the company or
at a later designated time or date, provided, however, that the operating
agreement may not become effective prior to formation of the company.
