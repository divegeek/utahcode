48-2c-1511.   Purchase of interest upon death, incapacity, or
disqualification of members.
The articles of organization may provide for the purchase of any member's
interest in a professional services company subject to this part upon the
death, incapacity, or disqualification of that member, or the same may be
provided in the operating agreement or by other private agreement.  In the
absence of such a provision in the articles of organization, the operating
agreement, or other private agreement, the professional services company shall
purchase the interest of a deceased member or an incapacitated member or a
member no longer qualified to own an interest in that professional services
company within 90 days after the company is notified of the death, incapacity,
or disqualification, as the case may be.  The price for the interest shall be
its reasonable fair market value as of the date of death, incapacity, or
disqualification.  If the professional services company fails to purchase said
interest by the end of said 90 days, then the personal representative of a
deceased member or the guardian or conservator of an incapacitated member or
the disqualified member may bring an action in the district court of the
county in which the principal office or place of practice of the professional
services company is located for the enforcement of this provision.  The court
shall have power to award the plaintiff the reasonable fair market value of
the interest, or within its jurisdiction, may order the liquidation of the
professional services company.  Further, if the plaintiff is successful in the
action, the plaintiff shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees
and costs.
