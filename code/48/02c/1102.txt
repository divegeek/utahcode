48-2c-1102 (Repealed 07/01/13).   Rights of assignee.

An assignment of an interest in a company does not entitle the assignee to participate in the management and affairs of the company or to vote or to become a member or to exercise any rights of a member or manager.  An assignment only entitles the assignee to receive, to the extent assigned, any share of profits and losses and distributions to which the assignor would be entitled.
