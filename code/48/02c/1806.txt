48-2c-1806.   Determination and authorization of indemnification.
(1)  A company may not indemnify a manager under Section 48-2c-1802 unless
authorized and a determination has been made in the specific case that
indemnification of the manager is permissible in the circumstances because the
manager has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section
48-2c-1802.  A company may not advance expenses to a manager under Section
48-2c-1804 unless authorized in the specific case after the written
affirmation and undertaking required by Subsections 48-2c-1804(1)(a) and (b)
are received and the determination required by Subsection 48-2c-1804(1)(c) has
been made.
(2)  The determinations required by Subsection (1) shall be made:
(a)  by the managers by a majority vote and only those managers not parties to
the proceeding shall be counted;
(b)  by special legal counsel selected by a majority vote of the managers of
the company who are not parties to the proceeding or, if none, by members
holding a majority interest in the profits of the company not counting any
interest held by the manager who is a party to the proceeding; or
(c)  by the members holding more than 50% interest in the profits of the
company not counting any interest held by the manager who is a party to the
proceeding.
(3)  Unless authorization is required by the operating agreement,
authorization of indemnification and advance of expenses shall be made in the
same manner as the determination that indemnification or advance of expenses
is permissible.  However, if the determination that indemnification or advance
of expenses is permissible is made by special legal counsel, authorization of
indemnification and advance of expenses shall be made by those entitled under
Subsection (2)(b) to select legal counsel.
