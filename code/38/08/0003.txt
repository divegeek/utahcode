(3)  If an owner sends a notice described in Subsection (2) by email and does not receive a response, return receipt, or delivery confirmation from the email address to which the notice was sent within three business days after the day on which the notice was sent, the owner shall deliver the notice in person or by certified mail to the person's last known address.

(4)  A written notice described in Subsection (1)(b) shall include:

(a)  an itemized statement of the owner's claim showing the sum due at the time of the notice and the date when the sum became due;

(b)  a brief description of the personal property subject to the lien that permits the person to identify the property, unless the property is locked, fastened, sealed, tied, or otherwise stored in a manner that prevents immediate identification of the property;

(c)  if permitted by the terms of the rental agreement, a notice that the occupant may not access the occupant's personal property until the occupant complies with the requirements described in Subsection (9);

(6) (a)  After the expiration of the time given in the notice, the owner shall publish an advertisement of the sale of the personal property subject to the lien once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the self-service storage facility is located.

(b)  An advertisement described in Subsection (6)(a) shall include:

(9)  Before a sale of personal property under this section, the occupant may pay the amount necessary to satisfy the lien and the reasonable expenses incurred under this section and thereby redeem the personal property; upon receipt of this payment, the owner shall return the personal property, and thereafter the owner shall have no liability to any person with respect to that personal property.

(10)  A purchaser in good faith of the personal property sold to satisfy a lien as provided for in this chapter takes the property free of any rights of persons against whom the lien was valid and free of any rights of a secured creditor, despite noncompliance by the owner with the requirements of this section.

(11)  In the event of a sale under this section, the owner may satisfy the lien for the proceeds of the sale, subject to the rights of any prior lienholder; the lien rights of the prior lienholder are automatically transferred to the proceeds of the sale; if the sale is made in good faith and is conducted in a reasonable manner, the owner shall not be subject to any surcharge for a deficiency in the amount of a prior secured lien, but shall hold the balance, if any, for delivery to the occupant, lienholder, or other person in interest; if the occupant, lienholder, or other person in interest does not claim the balance of the proceeds within one year of the date of sale, it shall become the property of the Utah state treasurer as unclaimed property with no further claim against the owner.

(12)  If the requirements of this chapter are not satisfied, if the sale of the personal property is not in conformity with the notice of sale, or if there is a willful violation of this chapter, nothing in this section affects the rights and liabilities of the owner, occupant, or any other person.
