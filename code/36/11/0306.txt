(2)  Except as provided in Subsection (3), a lobbyist may not represent a principal or client if the representation involves a conflict of interest.

(b)  the representation is not otherwise prohibited by law;

(c)  the representation does not require the lobbyist to assert a position on behalf of one principal or client that is opposed to the position of another principal or client represented by the lobbyist involving the same legislative issue; and

(d)  each affected principal or client gives informed consent to the conflict of interest in writing.
