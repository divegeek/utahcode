(1)  A director shall perform his duties as a director, and as a member of a committee, and each officer with discretionary authority shall perform his duties under that authority:

(b)  legal counsel, public accountants, or other persons as to matters the director or officer reasonably believes are within the person's professional or expert competence; or

(c)  in the case of a director, a committee of the board of directors of which he is not a member, if the director reasonably believes the committee merits confidence.

(3)  A director or officer is not acting in good faith if he has knowledge that makes reliance otherwise permitted by Subsection (2) unwarranted.
