3-1-14.   Removal of director.

Any member may ask for the removal of a director by filing charges with the secretary or president of the association, together with a petition signed by 10 per centum of the members requesting the removal of the director in question.  The removal shall be voted upon at the next meeting of the members, and the association may remove the director by a majority vote of the members voting thereon.  The director whose removal is requested shall be served with a copy of the charges not less than 10 days prior to the meeting and shall have an opportunity at the meeting to be heard in person and by counsel and to present evidence; and the persons requesting the removal shall have the same opportunity.  In case the bylaws provide for election of directors by districts, then the petition for removal of a director shall be signed by 20 per centum of the members residing in the district from which he was elected.  The board shall call a special meeting of the members residing in that district to consider the removal of the director; and by a majority vote of the members of that district voting thereon the director in question shall be removed from office.
