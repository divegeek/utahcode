If an action is commenced, the prevailing party may be awarded reasonable attorney's fees as determined by the court.

(3)  A lender may not be held liable under this section for a violation of this act if the lender shows that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures to avoid such errors.

(4)  A reserve account established or maintained in violation of this act is voidable, at the option of the borrower, his successors or assigns, at any time, but does not otherwise affect the validity of the loan, the security interest in the real property or any other obligation of the borrower.
