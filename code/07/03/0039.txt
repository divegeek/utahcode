of the bank stating its purpose and necessity;

(3)  the shareholder files a petition with a court of competent jurisdiction
requesting an order granting such access;

legitimate interest of a shareholder;

considers appropriate to protect the privacy of the customer; and

shareholder of the bank access to such records in accordance with the terms
and conditions of the order of the court.
