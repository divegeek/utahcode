(f)  the setoff of any debt owing to the institution against any claim against the institution.

(2)  Except as provided in Subsections (3), (4), (5), and (8):

(a)  the stay of any action against property of the institution continues until the institution has no interest in the property; and

(b)  the stay of any other action continues until the earlier of when the case is:

(3)  On the motion of any party in interest and after notice and a hearing, the court may terminate, annul, modify, condition, or otherwise grant relief from the stay:

(a)  for cause, including the lack of adequate protection of an interest in property of the party in interest; or

(b)  with respect to a stay of any action against property if:

(i)  the institution does not have an equity interest in the property; and

(ii)  the property would have no value in a reorganization or liquidation of the institution.

(4) (a)  Thirty days after a request under Subsection (3) for relief from the stay of any act against property of the institution, the stay is terminated with respect to the party in interest making the request unless the court, after notice and a hearing, orders the stay continued in effect pending the conclusion of, or as a result of, a final hearing and determination under Subsection (3).

(b)  A hearing under this Subsection (4) may be:

(i)  a preliminary hearing; or

(ii)  consolidated with the final hearing under Subsection (3).

(c)  The court shall order the stay continued in effect pending the conclusion of the final hearing under Subsection (3) if there is a reasonable likelihood that the party opposing relief from the stay will prevail at the conclusion of the final hearing.

(d)  If the hearing under this Subsection (4) is a preliminary hearing, the final hearing shall be commenced not later than 30 days after the conclusion of the preliminary hearing.

(5)  Upon request of a party in interest, the court, with or without a hearing, may grant relief from the stay provided under Subsection (1) to the extent necessary to prevent irreparable damage to the interest of an entity in property, if the interest will or could be damaged before there is an opportunity for notice and a hearing under Subsection (3) or (4).
