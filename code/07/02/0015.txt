7-2-15.   Priority of obligations, expenses, and claims -- Distribution of
balance of assets.
(1)  The following obligations, expenses, and claims have the following
priority:
(a)  first, any obligation the commissioner may have under Subsection
7-2-6(3)(b) to be bound by the terms, covenants, and conditions of obligations
secured by assets or property of the institution;
(b)  second, administrative expenses, including those allowed under Section
7-2-14;
(c)  third, unsecured claims for wages, salaries, or commissions, including
vacation, severance, or sick leave pay, earned by an individual within 90 days
before the date of the commissioner's possession, in an amount not exceeding
$2,000 for each individual;
(d)  fourth, claims of depositors.  Any federal deposit insurance agency or
other deposit insurer is subrogated to all rights of the depositors against
the institution, its officers and directors, and its persons in control of the
institution as control is defined in Section 7-1-103 to the extent of all
payments made for the benefit of the depositors.  "Payments," as used in this
subsection, includes arrangements by a federal deposit insurance agency for
the assumption or payment of the deposit liabilities by another institution
whose deposits are insured by a federal deposit insurance agency.  The right
of any agency of the United States insuring deposits or savings obligations to
be subrogated to the rights of depositors upon payment of their claims may not
be less extensive than the law of the United States provides with respect to
subrogation to the rights of depositors in national banks.  For the purposes
of this section, a contractual commitment to advance funds, including a
standby letter of credit, may not be considered a deposit liability of the
institution;
(e)  fifth, all other unsecured claims in amounts allowed by the court,
including claims of secured creditors to the extent the amount of their claims
exceed the present fair market value of their collateral.  The claim of a
lessor for damages resulting from the termination of a lease of property may
not be allowed in an amount in excess of the rent reserved by the lease,
without acceleration, for 60 days after the lessor repossessed the leased
property, or the leased property was surrendered to the lessor, whichever
first occurs, whether before or after the commissioner took possession of the
institution, plus any unpaid rent due under the lease, without acceleration,
on the date of possession or surrender.  A claim for damages resulting from
the termination of an employment contract, may not be allowed in an amount in
excess of the compensation provided by the contract, without acceleration, for
90 days after the employee was directed to terminate, or the employee
terminated, performance under the contract, whichever first occurs, whether
before or after the commissioner took possession of the institution, plus any
unpaid compensation due under the contract, without acceleration, on the date
the employee was directed to terminate or the employee terminated performance.
Claims for damages resulting from the termination of employment contracts of
persons who were in control of the institution, as control is defined in
Section 7-1-103, are not entitled to priority under this subsection.  Claims
for damages for breach of a commitment to advance funds shall be limited to
the amount due and owing by the institution on the date the commissioner took
possession of the institution;
(f)  sixth, claims for debt that are subordinated under the provisions of a
subordination agreement or other instrument;
(g)  seventh, claims of persons who were at any time in control of the
institution as control is defined in Section 7-1-103; and
(h)  eighth, all other claims.
(2)  The commissioner shall classify each claim presented for priority
purposes under Subsection (1) and shall indicate the classification on any
certificate issued under the provisions of Subsection 7-2-6(11). This
classification is final, subject to review by the court upon a timely
objection filed under Subsection 7-2-6(9).
(3)  When the commissioner has paid to each depositor and creditor of the
institution whose claims have been proved and allowed the full amount of the
claim, has made proper provision for unclaimed or unpaid deposits or
dividends, and has paid all the expenses of the liquidation, he shall
distribute the balance of the assets of the institution in his possession
among the shareholders of the institution in proportion to the holdings and
classes of this stock.  Unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines
otherwise, the shareholders shall be determined by the books and records of
the institution as of the date the commissioner took possession.
