(a)  its undertaking to pay all expenses incurred in conducting any
administrative proceedings forming part of the department's consideration of
the application;
(b)  its proposed articles of incorporation and by-laws;

qualifications of those proposed as officers;
(iii)  the character and standing in the community of those proposed as

the supervisor considers relevant.
(4) (a)  The supervisor shall submit findings and recommendations in writing
to the commissioner.
(b)  The application, any additional information furnished by the applicant,
and the findings and recommendations of the supervisor may be inspected by any
person at the department's office, except those portions of the application or
report the commissioner declares to be confidential, pursuant to the
applicant's request, in order to prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion of
privacy.
(5) (a)  If a hearing is held, the applicant shall publish notice of the
hearing at the applicant's expense:
(i)  in a newspaper of general circulation within the county where the
proposed institution is to be located at least once a week for three

of the application as complete, approve or disapprove the application based on
the papers filed with him, together with the supervisor's findings and
recommendations.
(7) (a)  The commissioner may not approve the application unless the
commissioner finds that the applicant has established by the preponderance of
the evidence that:
(i)  in light of the need for financial services in the area, the adequacy of
existing facilities, and the effect the proposed institution would have on
existing institutions in the area, the public need and convenience will be
promoted by the establishment of the proposed institution;
(ii)  in light of the ability of the proposed service area to support the
proposed institution, including the extent and nature of existing competition,
the economic history and future prospects of the community, and the
opportunity for profitable employment of financial institution funds,
conditions in the service area in which the proposed institution would
transact business afford reasonable promise of a successful operation;
(iii)  the institution is being formed only for legitimate purposes allowed by
the laws of this state;
(iv)  the proposed capital equals or exceeds the required minimum and is
adequate in light of current and prospective conditions;
(v)  if the applicant is seeking authority to accept deposits, the deposits
will be insured or guaranteed by an agency of the federal government;
(vi)  the proposed officers and directors have sufficient experience, ability,
and standing to afford reasonable promise of a successful operation;
(vii)  the name of the proposed financial institution does not resemble the
name of any other institution transacting business in this state so closely as
to cause confusion;
(viii)  the applicants have complied with all of the provisions of law; and
(ix)  no properly managed and soundly operated existing institutions offering
substantially similar services in the service area to which the application
relates will be unduly injured by approval of the application.
(b)  The commissioner may condition approval of the application on the
institution's acceptance of requirements or conditions with respect to

who have filed a protest to the application.
(9)  Upon approval of an application for authorization to conduct a business
subject to the jurisdiction of the department, the commissioner shall issue a
license, permit, or other appropriate certificate of authority if:
(a)  except in the case of credit unions, all of the capital of the
institution being formed has been paid in; and
(b)  all the conditions and other requirements for approval of the application
have been met.
(10) (a)  Any approval by the commissioner of an application under this
section is considered revoked unless the business is open and operating within
one year from the date of the approval.
