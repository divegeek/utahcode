7-1-607.   Lost or destroyed account book or certificate.

If the holder of record of an account as shown by the books of a depository institution, or his legal representative, files with the institution an affidavit to the effect that the account book or certificate has been lost or destroyed and has not been pledged or assigned in whole or in part, the institution shall issue a new account book or certificate in the name of the holder of record.  The new account book or certificate shall state that it is issued in lieu of the one lost or destroyed.  The institution is not liable thereafter on the original account book or certificate.  However, the board of directors of the institution shall, if in its judgment it is necessary, require a bond in an amount it considers sufficient to indemnify the institution against any loss which might result from the issuance of the new account book or certificate.
