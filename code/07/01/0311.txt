7-1-311.   Moratoriums on applications for new depository institutions or
branches.
The commissioner may establish, upon finding that applicable financial and
economic conditions require such action, a moratorium on accepting or acting
upon applications to conduct a business of depository institutions subject to
the jurisdiction of the department or to establish new branches or offices of
institutions subject to the jurisdiction of the department. The moratorium may
apply to the entire state or to such community or communities or other market
area or areas as the commissioner finds appropriate. No such period shall
extend for a period longer than one year, unless the commissioner finds that
the public interest requires renewal of the period for an additional period
not to exceed one year.
