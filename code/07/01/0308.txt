7-1-308.   Suspension or removal of director or officer -- Grounds --
Procedure for issuance of order.
(1) (a)  If the commissioner has determined that any officer or director of an
institution or other person under the jurisdiction of the department has:
(i)  violated any law, rule, regulation, or a cease and desist order which has
become final;
(ii)  engaged or participated in any unsafe or unsound practice in the conduct
of the affairs of the institution or other person;
(iii)  committed or engaged in any act, omission, or practice which
constitutes a breach of his fiduciary duty as an officer or director;
(iv)  been charged in any information, indictment, or complaint authorized by
a county attorney, a district attorney, or the attorney general of the state
relative to a violation of this title; or
(v)  been charged with the commission of or participation in a crime involving
dishonesty or breach of trust; and
(b)  if the commissioner determines that:
(i)  the institution or other person under the jurisdiction of the department
has suffered or will suffer substantial financial loss or other damage due to
such actions and that such action may impair the safety and soundness of the
institution or other person or prejudice in any manner the interests of the
depositors, members, creditors, or shareholders; or
(ii)  the director or officer has received financial gain by reason of any
breach of fiduciary duty; the commissioner may, after notice and opportunity
for hearing, serve upon such director or officer a written notice of
suspension or removal of the individual from office or prohibition from
further participation in the conduct of the affairs of the institution or
other person.
(2)  If the commissioner deems it necessary for the protection of an
institution or other person under the jurisdiction of the department or the
interests of its depositors, members, creditors, or shareholders, he may, by
written notice served upon the officer or director, suspend that officer or
director from office or prohibit him from further participation in any manner
in the conduct of the affairs of the institution or other person. The
suspension or prohibition is effective upon service of the notice and, unless
stayed by a court, shall remain in effect until the commissioner dismisses the
charges specified in the notice, or, if an order of removal or prohibition is
issued against the officer or director, until the effective date of that
order.
