7-1-601.   Adverse claim to account in depository institution -- Notice
required -- Bond may be required for payment.
Receipt of a notice of an adverse claim to a deposit or other account standing
on the books of any depository institution doing business in this state does
not obligate the depository institution to the adverse claimant, unless the
notice is given pursuant to an appropriate court order, obtained by the
adverse claimant in a legal action instituted by him in which the person to
whose credit the deposit stands is made a party. Such depository institution
may also pay the adverse claim, if the claimant executes to the depository
institution a good and sufficient bond in double the amount claimed,
indemnifying it from any and all liability, loss, damage, costs and expenses
including attorneys' fees for and on account of the payment of the adverse
claim or the dishonor of a check or other instrument of the person to whose
credit the deposit stands on its books.
