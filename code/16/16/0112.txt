16-16-112.   Reservation of name.
(1)  A person may reserve the exclusive use of the name of a limited
cooperative association, including a fictitious name for a foreign cooperative
whose name is not available under Section 16-16-111, by delivering an
application to the division for filing.  The application shall set forth the
name and address of the applicant and the name proposed to be reserved.  If
the division finds that the name applied for is available under Section
16-16-111, the division shall reserve the name for the applicant's exclusive
use for a nonrenewable period of 120 days.
(2)  A person that has reserved a name for a limited cooperative association
may transfer the reservation to another person by delivering to the division a
signed notice of the transfer which states the name, street address, and, if
different, the mailing address of the transferee.  If the person is an
organizer of the association and the name of the association is the same as
the reserved name, the delivery of articles of organization for filing by the
division is a transfer by the person to the association.
