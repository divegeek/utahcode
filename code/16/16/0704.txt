16-16-704.   Remedies for breach of contract.
(1)  Damages to be paid to a limited cooperative association for breach or
anticipatory repudiation of a marketing contract may be liquidated, but only
at an amount or under a formula that is reasonable in light of the actual or
anticipated harm caused by the breach or repudiation.  A provision that so
provides is not a penalty.
(2)  Upon a breach of a marketing contract, whether by anticipatory
repudiation or otherwise, a limited cooperative association may seek:
(a)  an injunction to prevent further breach; and
(b)  specific performance.
(3)  The remedies in this section are in addition to any other remedies
available to an association under law other than this chapter.
