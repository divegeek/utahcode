16-16-704.   Remedies for breach of contract.

(1)  Damages to be paid to a limited cooperative association for breach or anticipatory repudiation of a marketing contract may be liquidated, but only at an amount or under a formula that is reasonable in light of the actual or anticipated harm caused by the breach or repudiation.  A provision that so provides is not a penalty.

(2)  Upon a breach of a marketing contract, whether by anticipatory repudiation or otherwise, a limited cooperative association may seek:

(a)  an injunction to prevent further breach; and

(b)  specific performance.

(3)  The remedies in this section are in addition to any other remedies available to an association under law other than this chapter.
