16-16-1202.   Nonjudicial dissolution.
Except as otherwise provided in Sections 16-16-1203 and 16-16-1211, a limited
cooperative association is dissolved and its activities must be wound up:
(1)  upon the occurrence of an event or at a time specified in the articles of
organization;
(2)  upon the action of the association's organizers, board of directors, or
members under Section 16-16-1204 or 16-16-1205; or
(3)  90 days after the dissociation of a member, which results in the
association having one patron member and no other members, unless the
association:
(a)  has a sole member that is a cooperative; or
(b)  not later than the end of the 90-day period, admits at least one member
in accordance with the organic rules and has at least two members, at least
one of which is a patron member.
