16-16-404.   Voting by district, class, or voting group.
(1)  This section applies if the organic rules provide for voting by district
or class, or if there is one or more identifiable voting groups that a
proposed amendment to the organic rules would affect differently from other
members with respect to matters identified in Subsections 16-16-405(5)(a)
through (e).  Approval of the amendment requires the same percentage of votes
of the members of that district, class, or voting group required in Sections
16-16-405 and 16-16-514.
(2)  If a proposed amendment to the organic rules would affect members in two
or more districts or classes entitled to vote separately under Subsection (1)
in the same or a substantially similar way, the districts or classes affected
must vote as a single voting group unless the organic rules otherwise provide
for separate voting.
