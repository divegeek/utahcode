16-16-1405.   Noncomplying name of foreign cooperative.

(1)  A foreign cooperative whose name does not comply with Section 16-16-111 may not obtain a certificate of authority until it adopts, for the purpose of transacting business in this state, an alternative name that complies with Section 16-16-111.  A foreign cooperative that adopts an alternative name under this Subsection (1) and then obtains a certificate of authority with that name need not also comply with Section 42-2-5.  After obtaining a certificate of authority with an alternative name, a foreign cooperative's business in this state shall be transacted under that name unless the foreign cooperative is authorized under Section 42-2-5 to transact business in this state under another name.

(2)  If a foreign cooperative authorized to transact business in this state changes its name to one that does not comply with Section 16-16-111, it may not thereafter transact business in this state until it complies with Subsection (1) and obtains an amended certificate of authority.
