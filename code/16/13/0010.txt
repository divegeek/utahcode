16-13-10.   Amount of net earnings set apart as earned surplus.
Each year a development corporation shall set apart as earned surplus not less
than 10% of its net earnings for its preceding fiscal year until such surplus
is equal in value to one-half of the amount paid in on the shares of the
corporation then outstanding. Whenever the amount of surplus so established
shall become impaired, it shall be restored to the required amount in the
manner hereinbefore provided. Net earnings and surplus shall be determined by
the board of directors, after providing for such reserves as said directors
deem desirable, and the directors' determination made in good faith shall be
conclusive on all persons.
