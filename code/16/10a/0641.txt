16-10a-641.   Unclaimed distributions.
If a corporation has mailed three successive distributions to a shareholder
addressed to the shareholder's address shown on the corporation's current
record of shareholders and the distributions have been returned as
undeliverable, no further attempt to deliver distributions to the shareholder
need be made until another address for the shareholder is made known to the
corporation, at which time all distributions accumulated by reason of this
section shall, except as otherwise provided by law, be mailed to the
shareholder at the other address.
