16-10a-1103.   Action on plan.
(1)  After adopting a plan of merger or share exchange, the board of directors
of each corporation party to the merger, and the board of directors of each
corporation whose shares will be acquired in the share exchange, shall submit
the plan of merger to its shareholders for approval, except as provided in:
(a)  Subsection (7);
(b)  Section 16-10a-1104; or
(c)  the plan of share exchange.
(2)  For a plan of merger or share exchange to be approved:
(a)  the board of directors shall recommend the plan of merger or share
exchange to the shareholders, unless the board of directors determines that
because of conflict of interest or other special circumstances it should make
no recommendation and communicates the basis for its determination to the
shareholders with the plan; and
(b)  the shareholders entitled to vote on the plan of merger or share exchange
shall approve the plan as provided in Subsection (5).
(3)  The board of directors may condition its submission of the proposed
merger or share exchange on any basis.
(4)  The corporation shall give notice of the shareholders' meeting in
accordance with Section 16-10a-705 to each shareholder entitled to vote on the
plan of merger or share exchange.  The notice shall state that one of the
purposes of the meeting is to consider the plan of merger or share exchange
and contain or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the plan.
(5)  Unless this chapter, the articles of incorporation, the initial bylaws,
the amended bylaws, or the board of directors acting pursuant to Subsection
(3) requires a greater vote, the plan of merger or share exchange to be
authorized shall be approved by each voting group entitled to vote separately
on the plan by a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the plan by
that voting group.
(6)  Separate voting by voting groups is required on a plan of:
(a)  merger if the plan contains a provision that, if contained in an
amendment to the articles of incorporation, would require action by one or
more separate voting groups on the amendment under Section 16-10a-1004; and
(b)  share exchange by each class or series of shares included in the share
exchange, with each class or series constituting a separate voting group.
(7)  Action by the shareholders of the surviving corporation on a plan of
merger is not required if:
(a)  the articles of incorporation of the surviving corporation will not
differ, except for amendments enumerated in Section 16-10a-1002, from its
articles of incorporation before the merger;
(b)  each shareholder of the surviving corporation whose shares were
outstanding immediately before the merger will hold the same number of shares,
with identical designations, preferences, limitations, and relative rights,
immediately after the merger;
(c)  the number of voting shares outstanding immediately after the merger,
plus the number of voting shares issuable as a result of the merger either by
the conversion of securities issued pursuant to the merger or the exercise of
rights and warrants issued pursuant to the merger, will not exceed by more
than 20% the total number of voting shares of the surviving corporation
outstanding immediately before the merger; and
(d)  the number of participating shares outstanding immediately after the
merger, plus the number of participating shares issuable as a result of the
merger either by the conversion of securities issued pursuant to the merger or
the exercise of rights and warrants issued pursuant to the merger, will not
exceed by more than 20% the total number of participating shares outstanding
immediately before the merger.
(8)  As used in Subsection (7):
(a)  "Participating shares" means shares that entitle their holders to
participate without limitation in distributions.
(b)  "Voting shares" means shares that entitle their holders to vote
unconditionally in elections of directors.
(9)  After a plan of merger or share exchange is approved, and at any time
before the merger or share exchange becomes effective the merger or share
exchange may be abandoned, subject to any contractual rights, without further
shareholder action, in accordance with the procedure set forth in the plan of
merger or share exchange or, if none is set forth, in the manner determined by
the board of directors.
(10)  If a merger or share exchange is abandoned after articles of merger or
share exchange have been filed by the division pursuant to Section 16-10a-1105
specifying a delayed effective date, the merger or share exchange may be
prevented from becoming effective by delivering to the division for filing
prior to the specified effective time and date a statement of abandonment
stating that by appropriate corporate action the merger or share exchange has
been abandoned.  The statement of abandonment shall be executed in the same
manner as the articles of merger or share exchange.
