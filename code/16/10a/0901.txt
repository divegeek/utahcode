A director is considered to be serving an employee benefit plan at the corporation's request if his duties to the corporation also impose duties on, or otherwise involve services by, him to the plan or to participants in or beneficiaries of the plan. "Director" includes, unless the context requires otherwise, the estate or personal representative of a director.

An officer, employee, fiduciary, or agent is considered to be serving an employee benefit plan at the corporation's request if that person's duties to the corporation also impose duties on, or otherwise involve services by, that person to the plan or participants in, or beneficiaries of the plan. Unless the context requires otherwise, such terms include the estates or personal representatives of such persons.

(6) (a)  "Official capacity" means:

(i)  when used with respect to a director, the office of director in a corporation; and
