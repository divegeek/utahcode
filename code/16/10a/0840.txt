16-10a-840.   General standards of conduct for directors and officers.

(1)  Each director shall discharge his duties as a director, including duties as a member of a committee, and each officer with discretionary authority shall discharge his duties under that authority:

(a)  in good faith;

(b)  with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances; and

(c)  in a manner the director or officer reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation.

(2)  In discharging his duties, a director or officer is entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports, or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, if prepared or presented by:

(a)  one or more officers or employees of the corporation whom the director or officer reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented;

(b)  legal counsel, public accountants, or other persons as to matters the director or officer reasonably believes are within the person's professional or expert competence; or

(c)  in the case of a director, a committee of the board of directors of which he is not a member, if the director reasonably believes the committee merits confidence.

(3)  A director or officer is not acting in good faith if he has knowledge concerning the matter in question that makes reliance otherwise permitted by Subsection (2) unwarranted.

(4)  A director or officer is not liable to the corporation, its shareholders, or any conservator or receiver, or any assignee or successor-in-interest thereof, for any action taken, or any failure to take any action, as an officer or director, as the case may be, unless:

(a)  the director or officer has breached or failed to perform the duties of the office in compliance with this section; and

(b)  the breach or failure to perform constitutes gross negligence, willful misconduct, or intentional infliction of harm on the corporation or the shareholders.
