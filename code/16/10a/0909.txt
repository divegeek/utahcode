(1)  A provision treating a corporation's indemnification of, or advance for expenses to, directors that is contained in its articles of incorporation or bylaws, in a resolution of its shareholders or board of directors, or in a contract (except an insurance policy) or otherwise, is valid only if and to the extent the provision is not inconsistent with this part.  If the articles of incorporation limit indemnification or advance of expenses, indemnification and advance of expenses are valid only to the extent not inconsistent with the articles of incorporation.

(2)  This part does not limit a corporation's power to pay or reimburse expenses incurred by a director in connection with the director's appearance as a witness in a proceeding at a time when the director has not been made a named defendant or respondent to the proceeding.
