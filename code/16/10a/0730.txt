16-10a-730.   Voting trusts.

(1)  One or more shareholders may create a voting trust, conferring on a trustee the right to vote or otherwise act for them, by signing an agreement setting out the provisions of the trust, and transferring to the trustee the shares with respect to which the trustee is to act.  When a voting trust agreement is signed, the trustee shall prepare a list of the names and addresses of all owners of beneficial interests in the trust, together with the number and class of shares each transferred to the trust, and promptly cause the corporation to receive copies of the list and agreement.  Thereafter the trustee shall cause the corporation to receive changes to the list promptly as they occur and amendments to the agreement promptly as they are made.

(2)  A voting trust becomes effective on the date the first shares subject to the trust are registered in the trustee's name.  A voting trust is valid for the period provided in the agreement, but not more than 10 years after its effective date unless extended under Subsection (3).

(3)  All or some of the parties to a voting trust may extend the voting trust for additional terms of not more than 10 years each by signing an extension agreement and obtaining the trustee's written consent to the extension.  An extension is valid for not more than 10 years from the date the first shareholder signs the extension agreement.  The trustee shall deliver copies of the extension agreement and list of beneficial owners to the corporation's principal office.  An extension agreement binds only those parties signing it.
