(1)  A subscription for shares entered into before incorporation is irrevocable for six months unless the subscription agreement provides a longer or shorter period or all the subscribers agree or the corporation consents to revocation of the subscription and provided the subscription is not considered revocable under the federal securities laws.

(2)  The acceptance by the corporation of a subscription entered into before incorporation and the authorization of the issuance of shares pursuant thereto are subject to Section 16-10a-621.

(3)  The board of directors may determine the payment terms of subscriptions for shares that were entered into before incorporation, unless the subscription agreement specifies them.  A call for payment by the board of directors shall be uniform so far as practicable as to all shares of the same class or series, unless the subscription agreement specifies otherwise.

(6)  A subscription agreement entered into after incorporation is a contract between the subscriber and the corporation subject to Section 16-10a-621.
