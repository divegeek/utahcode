16-10a-853.   Shareholders' action.

(1)  Shareholders' action respecting a transaction is effective for purposes of Subsection 16-10a-851(2)(b) if a quorum existed pursuant to Subsection (2) and a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of qualified shares present in person or by proxy at the meeting were cast in favor of the transaction after notice to shareholders describing the director's conflicting interest transaction, provision of the information referred to in Subsection (3), and required disclosure to the shareholders who voted on the transaction, to the extent the information was not known by them.

(2)  A majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all qualified shares constitutes a quorum for purposes of action that complies with this section.  Subject to the provisions of Subsections (3) and (4), shareholders' action that otherwise complies with this section is not affected by the presence of holders of, or the voting of, shares that are not qualified shares.

(3)  For purposes of compliance with Subsection (1), a director who has a conflicting interest respecting the transaction shall, before the shareholders vote, inform the secretary or other officer or agent of the corporation authorized to tabulate votes of the number and the identity of persons holding or controlling the vote, of all shares that the director knows are beneficially owned, or the voting of which is controlled, by the director or by a related person of the director, or both.

(4)  If a shareholders' vote does not comply with Subsection (1) solely because of a failure of a director to comply with Subsection (3), and if the director establishes that the failure did not determine and was not intended by him to influence the outcome of the vote, the court may, with or without further proceedings under Subsection 16-10a-851(2)(c), take any action respecting the transaction and the director, and give any effect to the shareholders' vote, as it considers appropriate in the circumstances.
