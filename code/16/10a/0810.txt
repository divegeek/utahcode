(c)  if the directors remaining in office constitute fewer than a quorum of the board, they may fill the vacancy by the affirmative vote of a majority of all the directors remaining in office.

(2)  Unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation, if the vacant office was held or is to be held by a director elected by a voting group of shareholders:

(a)  if one or more of the other directors elected by the same voting group are serving, only they are entitled to vote to fill the vacancy if it is filled by the directors; and
