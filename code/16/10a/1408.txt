(1)  under Section 16-10a-1406 or 16-10a-1407 against the dissolved corporation, to the extent of its undistributed assets; or

(2)  against a shareholder of the dissolved corporation, if the assets have been distributed in liquidation; but a shareholder's total liability for all claims under this section may not exceed the total value of assets distributed to him, as that value is determined at the time of distribution.
