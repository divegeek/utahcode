16-10a-823.   Waiver of notice.

(1)  A director may waive any notice of a meeting before or after the date and time of the meeting stated in the notice.  Except as provided by Subsection (2), the waiver shall be in writing and signed by the director entitled to the notice.  The waiver shall be delivered to the corporation for filing with the corporate records, but delivery and filing are not conditions to its effectiveness.

(2)  A director's attendance at or participation in a meeting waives any required notice to the director of the meeting unless the director at the beginning of the meeting, or promptly upon the director's arrival, objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting because of lack of notice or defective notice, and does not thereafter vote for or assent to action taken at the meeting.
