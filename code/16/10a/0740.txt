(ii)  may not extend to any facts or substantive matters with respect to the act, omission, or other matter that is the subject matter of the derivative proceeding.

(4) (a)  A derivative proceeding shall be dismissed by the court on motion by the corporation if a person or group specified in Subsections (4)(b) or (4)(f) determines in good faith after conducting a reasonable inquiry upon which its conclusions are based that the maintenance of the derivative proceeding is not in the best interests of the corporation.

(b)  Unless a panel is appointed pursuant to Subsection (4)(f), the determination in Subsection (4)(a) shall be made by:
