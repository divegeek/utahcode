(e)  If a corporation proposes to dismiss a derivative proceeding pursuant to Subsection (4)(a), discovery by a shareholder following the filing of the derivative proceeding in accordance with this section:

(ii)  may not extend to any facts or substantive matters with respect to the act, omission, or other matter that is the subject matter of the derivative proceeding.

(4) (a)  A derivative proceeding shall be dismissed by the court on motion by the corporation if a person or group specified in Subsections (4)(b) or (4)(f) determines in good faith after conducting a reasonable inquiry upon which its conclusions are based that the maintenance of the derivative proceeding is not in the best interests of the corporation.

(b)  Unless a panel is appointed pursuant to Subsection (4)(f), the determination in Subsection (4)(a) shall be made by:

(i)  a majority vote of independent directors present at a meeting of the board of directors if the independent directors constitute a quorum; or

(d)  If a derivative proceeding is commenced after a determination has been made rejecting a demand by a shareholder, the complaint shall allege with particularity facts establishing either:

(i)  that a majority of the board of directors did not consist of independent directors at the time the determination was made; or

(ii)  that the requirements of Subsection (4)(a) have not been met.

(ii)  interposed for an improper purpose, such as to:
