(1)  A corporation may pay for or reimburse the reasonable expenses incurred
by a director who is a party to a proceeding in advance of final disposition
of the proceeding if:

faith belief that he has met the applicable standard of conduct described in
Section 16-10a-902;
(b)  the director furnishes to the corporation a written undertaking, executed
personally or on his behalf, to repay the advance if it is ultimately
