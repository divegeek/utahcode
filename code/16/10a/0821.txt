(1)  Unless the articles of incorporation, bylaws, or this chapter provide otherwise, action required or permitted by this chapter to be taken at a board of directors' meeting may be taken without a meeting if all members of the board consent to the action in writing.

(2) (a)  Action is taken under this section at the time the last director signs a writing describing the action taken, unless, prior to that time, any director has revoked a consent by a writing signed by the director and received by the secretary or any other person authorized by the bylaws or the board of directors to receive the revocation.

(b) (i)  Unless otherwise provided by the bylaws, a director may deliver a written consent under this section by an electronic transmission that provides the corporation with a complete copy of the written consent.
