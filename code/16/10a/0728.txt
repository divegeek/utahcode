16-10a-728.   Voting for directors -- Cumulative voting.
(1)  At each election of directors, unless otherwise provided in the articles
of incorporation or this chapter, every shareholder entitled to vote at the
election has the right to cast, in person or by proxy, all of the votes to
which the shareholder's shares are entitled for as many persons as there are
directors to be elected and for whose election the shareholder has the right
to vote.
(2)  Unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation or this
chapter, directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the shares
entitled to vote in the election, at a meeting of shareholders at which a
quorum is present.
(3)  Shareholders do not have a right to cumulate their votes for the election
of directors unless the articles of incorporation so provide.
(4)  A statement included in the articles of incorporation to the effect that
all or a designated voting group of shareholders are entitled to cumulate
their votes for directors, means that the shareholders designated are entitled
to multiply the number of votes they are entitled to cast by the number of
directors for whom they are entitled to vote and cast the product for a single
candidate or distribute the product among two or more candidates.
(5)  Shares entitled to vote cumulatively may be voted cumulatively at each
election of directors unless the articles of incorporation provide alternative
procedures for the exercise of the cumulative voting rights.
