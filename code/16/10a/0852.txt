16-10a-852.   Directors' action.
(1)  Directors' action respecting a transaction is taken for purposes of
Subsection 16-10a-851(2)(a) if the transaction received the affirmative vote
of a majority of those qualified directors on the board of directors or on a
duly empowered committee of the board who voted on the transaction after
either required disclosure to them, to the extent the information was not
known by them, or compliance with Subsection (2), provided that action by a
committee is effective under this subsection only if:
(a)  all its members are qualified directors; and
(b)  its members are either all of the qualified directors or are appointed by
the affirmative vote of a majority of the qualified directors.
(2)  If a director has a conflicting interest respecting a transaction, but
neither the director nor a related person of the director is a party to the
transaction, and if the director has a duty under law or professional canon,
or a duty of confidentiality to another person, respecting information
relating to the transaction so that the director may not make the disclosure
described in Section 16-10a-850(4)(b), then disclosure is sufficient for
purposes of Subsection (1) if the director discloses to the directors voting
on the transaction, before their vote, the existence and nature of the
conflicting interest and informs them of the character and limitations imposed
by that duty.
(3)  A majority of the qualified directors on the board of directors or on the
committee, as the case may be, constitutes a quorum for purposes of action
that complies with this section.  Directors' action that otherwise complies
with this section is not affected by the presence or vote of a director who is
not a qualified director.
