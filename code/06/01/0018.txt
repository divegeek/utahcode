6-1-18.   Death or neglect of assignee.

If an assignee dies before the closing of his trust, or shall fail or neglect for the period of 20 days after making of any assignment to file an inventory and valuation and give bond as required in this title, the district court or any judge thereof of the county where such assignment may be recorded, on the application of any person interested, shall appoint some person to execute the trust, who shall on giving bond have all the powers of the assignee first appointed and be subject to all the duties hereby imposed. If it is shown to the court at any time that an assignee is guilty of wasting or misapplying the trust fund, he may be removed, and a successor appointed in the same manner.
