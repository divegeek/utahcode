11-25-2.   Legislative findings -- Liberal construction.
The legislature finds and declares that it is necessary for the welfare of the
state and its inhabitants that community development and renewal agencies be
authorized within cities, towns or counties, or cities or towns and counties
to make long-term, low-interest loans to finance residential rehabilitation in
selected residential areas in order to encourage the upgrading of property in
those areas.  Unless such agencies provide some form of assistance to finance
residential rehabilitation, many residential areas will deteriorate at an
accelerated pace.  This act shall be liberally construed to effect its
purposes.
