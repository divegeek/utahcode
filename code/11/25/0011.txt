Prior to the issuance of any bonds or bond anticipation notes of the agency for residential rehabilitation, the agency shall by ordinance adopt a comprehensive residential rehabilitation financing program, including:

(b)  Financial assistance from the agency for residential rehabilitation is necessary to arrest the deterioration of the area.

(c)  Financing of residential rehabilitation in the area is economically feasible.

(a)  Outstanding loans on the property to be rehabilitated including the amount of the loans for rehabilitation, may not exceed 80% of the anticipated after-rehabilitation value of the property to be rehabilitated, except that the agency may authorize loans of up to 95% of the anticipated after-rehabilitation value of the property if loans are made for the purpose of rehabilitating the property for residential purposes, there is demonstrated need for such higher limit, and there is a high probability that the value of the property will not be impaired during the term of the loan.

(b)  The maximum repayment period for residential rehabilitation loans shall be 20 years or 3/4 of the economic life of the property, whichever is less.

(c)  The maximum amount loan for rehabilitation for each dwelling unit and for each commercial unit which is, or is part of a "residence" as defined in this chapter, shall be established by resolution of the agency.
