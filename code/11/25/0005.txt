An agency may, from time to time, issue its negotiable bonds or notes for the purpose of financing residential rehabilitation as authorized by this act and for the purpose of funding or refunding these bonds or notes in the same manner as it may issue other bonds or notes as provided in Title 17C, Chapter 1, Part 5, Agency Bonds.  Every issue of its bonds shall be a special obligation of the agency payable from all or any part of the revenues specified in the act or funds legally received by the agency.
