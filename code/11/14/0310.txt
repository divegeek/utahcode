Such taxes shall be levied and collected by the same officers, at the same time and in the same manner as are other taxes levied for the local political subdivision.

(2)  If any local political subdivision shall neglect or fail for any reason to levy or collect or cause to be levied or collected sufficient taxes for the prompt and punctual payment of such principal and interest, any person in interest may enforce levy and collection thereof in any court having jurisdiction of the subject matter, and any suit, action or proceeding brought by such person in interest shall be a preferred cause and shall be heard and disposed of without delay.  All provisions of the constitution and laws relating to the collection of county and municipal taxes and tax sales shall also apply to and regulate the collection of the taxes levied pursuant to this section, through the officer whose duty it is to collect the taxes and money due the local political subdivision.
