11-17-1.5.   Purpose of chapter.
(1) (a)  The purposes of this chapter are to stimulate the economic growth of
the state, to promote employment and achieve greater industrial development in
the state, to maintain or enlarge domestic or foreign markets for Utah
industrial products, to authorize municipalities and counties in the state to
facilitate capital formation, finance, acquire, own, lease, or sell projects
for the purpose of reducing, abating, or preventing pollution and to protect
and promote the health, welfare, and safety of the citizens of the state and
to improve local health and the general welfare by inducing corporations,
persons, or entities engaged in health care services, including hospitals,
nursing homes, extended care facilities, facilities for the care of persons
with a physical or mental disability, and administrative and support
facilities, to locate, relocate, modernize, or expand in this state and to
assist in the formation of investment capital with respect thereto.
(b)  The Legislature declares that the acquisition or financing, or both, of
projects under the Utah Industrial Facilities and Development Act and the
issuance of bonds under it constitutes a proper public purpose.
(2) (a)  It is declared that the policy of the state is to encourage the
development of free enterprise and entrepreneurship for the purpose of the
expansion of employment opportunities and economic development.
(b)  It is declared that there exists in the state an inadequate amount of
locally managed, pooled venture capital in the private sector available to
invest in early stage businesses having high growth potential and that can
provide jobs for Utah citizens.
(c)  It is found that venture capital is required for healthy economic
development of sectors of the economy having high growth and employment
potential.
(d)  It is further found that the public economic development purposes of the
state and its counties and municipalities can be fostered by the sale of
industrial revenue bonds for the purpose of providing funding for locally
managed, pooled new venture and economic development funds in accordance with
the provisions of this chapter.
(e)  It is declared that in order to assure adequate investment of private
capital for these uses, cooperation between private enterprise and state and
local government is necessary and in the public interest and that the
facilitation of capital accumulation is the appropriate activity of the
counties and municipalities of this state and also of the Governor's Office of
Economic Development.
(f)  It is found that venture capital funds historically, because of the more
intensive nature of their relationship with companies in which they invest,
tend to concentrate their investments within a relatively close geographical
area to their headquarters location.
(g)  It is found and declared that investors in economic development or new
venture investment funds require for the overall security of their investments
reasonable diversification of investment portfolios and that, in the course of
this diversification, investments are often syndicated or jointly made among
several financial institutions or funds.  It is expressly found and declared
that an economic development or new venture investment fund must from time to
time for its optimal profitability and efficiency (which are important for the
security and profit of bond purchasers providing funds therefor) cooperate
with others who may be located outside of Utah or the county or municipality
where the fund is headquartered in the making of investments and that the fund
must be free in the interests of reciprocal relationships with other financial
institutions and diversification of risks to invest from time to time in
enterprises that are located outside of Utah or the counties or
municipalities.  It is specifically found that such activity by a locally
managed fund, funded in whole or in part with the proceeds of bonds sold under
this chapter, is within the public purposes of the state and any county or
municipality offering the bonds, provided that the fund locates within Utah or
the county or municipality its headquarters where its actual investment
decisions and management functions occur and limits the aggregate amount of
its investments in companies located outside of Utah to an amount that in the
aggregate does not exceed the aggregate amount of investments made by
institutions and funds located outside of Utah in Utah companies, that the
locally managed fund has sponsored or in which it has invested and that it has
brought to the attention of investors outside of Utah.
