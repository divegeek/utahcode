11-17-3.   Powers of municipalities, counties, and state universities.
(1)  Each municipality, county, and state university may:
(a)  finance or acquire, whether by construction, purchase, devise, gift,
exchange, or lease, or any one or more of those methods, and construct,
reconstruct, improve, maintain, equip, and furnish or fund one or more
projects, which shall be located within this state, and which shall be located
within, or partially within, the municipality or county or within the county
within which a state university is located, unless an agreement under the
Interlocal Cooperation Act has been entered into as authorized by Subsection
(5), except that if a governing body finds, by resolution, that the effects of
international trade practices have been or will be adverse to Utah
manufacturers of industrial products and, therefore, it is desirable to
finance a project in order to maintain or enlarge domestic or foreign markets
for Utah industrial products, a project may consist of the financing on behalf
of a user of the costs of acquiring industrial products manufactured in, and
which are to be exported from, the state;
(b)  finance for, sell, lease, contract the management of, or otherwise
dispose of to, any person, firm, partnership, or corporation, either public or
private, including without limitation any person, firm, partnership, or
corporation engaged in business for a profit, any or all of its projects upon
the terms and conditions as the governing body considers advisable and which
do not conflict with this chapter;
(c)  issue revenue bonds for the purpose of defraying the cost of financing,
acquiring, constructing, reconstructing, improving, maintaining, equipping,
furnishing, or funding any project and secure the payment of the bonds as
provided in this chapter, which revenue bonds may be issued in one or more
series or issues where considered advisable, and each series or issue may
contain different maturity dates, interest rates, priorities on securities
available for guaranteeing payment of them, and other differing terms and
conditions considered necessary and not in conflict with this chapter;
(d) (i)  grant options to renew any lease with respect to any project and to
buy any project at a price the governing body considers desirable; and
(ii)  sell and convey any real or personal property acquired under Subsection
(1)(a) at public or private sale, and make an order respecting the sale
considered conducive to the best interests of the municipality, county, or
state university, the sale or conveyance to be subject to the terms of any
lease but to be free and clear of any other encumbrance;
(e)  establish, acquire, develop, maintain, and operate industrial parks; and
(f)  offer to the holders of its bonds issued pursuant to this chapter the
right, where its governing body considers it appropriate, to convert the bonds
or some portion of the bond obligation into an equity position in some or all
of the assets developed with the proceeds of the bond offering.
(2)  An economic development or new venture investment fund shall be
considered to be located in the municipality or county where its headquarters
is located or where any office of it is located, as long as it is
headquartered within the state. It need not make all of its investments within
the state or such county or municipality, so long as it locates within the
state or such county or municipality its headquarters where its actual
investment decisions and management functions occur and agrees to, and does,
limit the aggregate amount of its investments in companies located outside the
state to an amount which in the aggregate does not exceed the aggregate amount
of investments made by institutions and funds located outside the state in
companies headquartered in Utah which the locally managed fund has sponsored
or in which it has invested and which it has brought to the attention of
investors outside the state.  For purposes of enabling an offering of bonds to
fund such a fund, a certification of an executive managerial officer of the
manager of said fund of the intention to comply with this provision may be
relied upon.  Each fund shall at least annually certify to the governmental
offeror of such bonds its compliance with this provision.
(3)  Before any municipality, county, or state university issues revenue bonds
under this chapter for the purpose of defraying the cost of acquiring,
constructing, reconstructing, improving, maintaining, equipping, or furnishing
any industrial park project, the governing body of the state university,
county, or municipality shall adopt and establish a plan of development for
the tracts of land to constitute the industrial park and shall, by resolution,
find that the project for the establishment of the industrial park is well
conceived and has a reasonable prospect of success, that the project will tend
to provide proper economic development of the municipality or county and will
encourage industry to locate within or near the municipality or county or, in
the case of state universities, will further, through industrial research and
development, the instructional progress of the state university.  There may be
included as a part of any plan of development for any industrial park zoning
regulations, restrictions on usage of sites within the boundaries of the
industrial park, minimum size of sites, parking and loading regulations, and
methods for the providing and furnishing of police and fire protection and for
the furnishing of other municipal or county services which are considered
necessary in order to provide for the maintenance of the public health and
safety.  If any water or sewerage facilities are to be acquired as part of the
development of the land for an industrial park under this chapter, water and
sewerage facilities may be acquired as part of the issue of bonds issued under
this chapter, through the issuance of bonds payable from water and sewer
charges in the manner as is now or as may hereafter be provided by law, in
combination with an issue of refunding bonds, in combination with an issue of
bonds upon the consent of the holders of outstanding bonds issued for the same
purpose, in combination with bonds issued for the purposes of financing water
and sewer facilities which will not be a part of an industrial park, or in any
combination of the foregoing.  Any municipality, county, or state university
establishing an industrial park may lease any land acquired and developed as
part of an industrial park to one or more lessees.  The lessee may sublease
all or a portion of the land so leased from the municipality or county.
Municipalities, counties, and state universities may sell or lease land in
connection with the establishment, acquisition, development, maintenance, and
operation of an industrial park project.  Any such lease or sale of land shall
be undertaken only after the adoption by the governing body of a resolution
authorizing the lease or sale of the land for industrial park purposes.
(4) (a)  No municipality, county, or state university may operate any project
referred to in this section, as a business or in any other manner except as
the lessor or administrator of it, nor may it acquire any such project, or any
part of it, by condemnation.  This prohibition does not apply to projects
involving research conducted, administered, or managed by a state university.
(b)  No municipality, county, or state university may, under this chapter,
acquire or lease projects, or issue revenue bonds for the purpose of defraying
the cost of any project or part of it, used for the generation, transmission,
or distribution of electric energy beyond the project site, or the production,
transmission, or distribution of natural gas, except for any project defined
in Subsection 11-17-2(8)(b) or (d).
(5)  Each municipality, county, and state university may enter, either before
or after the bonds have been issued, into interlocal agreements under Title
11, Chapter 13, Interlocal Cooperation Act, with one or more municipalities,
counties, state universities, or special service districts created pursuant to
Title 17D, Chapter 1, Special Service District Act, in order to accomplish
economies of scale or other cost savings and any other additional purposes to
be specified in the interlocal agreement, for the issuance of bonds under this
chapter on behalf of all of the signatories to the interlocal agreement by one
of the municipalities, counties, or state universities which is a signatory to
the interlocal agreement for the financing or acquisition of projects
qualifying as a project under Subsection 11-17-2(8). For all purposes of
Section 11-13-207 the signatory to the interlocal agreement designated as the
issuer of the bonds constitutes the administrator of the interlocal agreement.
