11-1-2.   Auditors may rely on certain facts.
Whenever a county legislative body, board of city commissioners, city council,
or board of education of any such county, city, or school district shall find
or declare that any appropriation or expenditure for which a warrant or
warrants are to be issued was or is for interest upon the bonded debt, for
salaries, or for the current expenses of such county, city, or school
district, such finding or declaration shall conclusively protect the county
auditor, city auditor, or clerk of the board of education of any such county,
city, or school district, as to such facts, in certifying any warrant or
warrants therefor to be within the lawful debt limit of such county, city, or
school district.
