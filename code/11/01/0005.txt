All payments of funds either as principal or interest on any bonds issued by any county, municipality, school district or other taxing unit within this state paid to anyone other than the owner of such bonds shall be regarded and held as trust funds, and the person, firm or corporation so receiving the same shall be held as a trustee of such funds holding the same for the benefit of the owners and holders of such bonds until the same are fully paid over. Until such funds are paid over by the person, firm or corporation collecting the same, they shall be set up and held in a separate trust account and not commingled or used by the collector in any manner whatever.
