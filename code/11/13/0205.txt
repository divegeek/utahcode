entity to own sewage and wastewater facilities -- Powers and duties of new
entities -- Validation of previously created entities -- Notice to lieutenant
governor -- Recording requirements.
(1)  It is declared that the policy of the state is to assure the health,
safety, and welfare of its citizens, that adequate sewage and wastewater
treatment plants and facilities are essential to the well-being of the
citizens of the state and that the acquisition of adequate sewage and
wastewater treatment plants and facilities on a regional basis in accordance
with federal law and state and federal water quality standards and effluent
standards in order to provide services to public agencies is a matter of
statewide concern and is in the public interest.  It is found and declared
that there is a statewide need to provide for regional sewage and wastewater
treatment plants and facilities, and as a matter of express legislative
determination it is declared that the compelling need of the state for
construction of regional sewage and wastewater treatment plants and facilities
requires the creation of entities under the Interlocal Cooperation Act to own,
construct, operate, and finance sewage and wastewater treatment plants and
facilities; and it is the purpose of this law to provide for the
accomplishment thereof in the manner provided in this section.
(2)  Any two or more public agencies of the state may also agree to approve
the creation of a separate legal or administrative entity to accomplish and
undertake the purpose of owning, acquiring, constructing, financing,
operating, maintaining, and repairing regional sewage and wastewater treatment
plants and facilities.
(3)  A separate legal or administrative entity created under this section is
considered to be a political subdivision and body politic and corporate of the
state with power to carry out and effectuate its corporate powers, including
the power:
(a)  to adopt, amend, and repeal rules, bylaws, and regulations, policies, and
procedures for the regulation of its affairs and the conduct of its business,
to sue and be sued in its own name, to have an official seal and power to
alter that seal at will, and to make and execute contracts and all other
instruments necessary or convenient for the performance of its duties and the
exercise of its powers and functions under the Interlocal Cooperation Act;
(b)  to own, acquire, construct, operate, maintain, repair, or cause to be
constructed, operated, maintained, and repaired one or more regional sewage
and wastewater treatment plants and facilities, all as shall be set forth in
the agreement providing for its creation;
(c)  to borrow money, incur indebtedness and issue revenue bonds, notes or
other obligations payable solely from the revenues and receipts derived from
all or a portion of the regional sewage and wastewater treatment plants and
facilities which it owns, operates, and maintains, such bonds, notes, or other
obligations to be issued and sold in compliance with the provisions of Title
11, Chapter 14, Local Government Bonding Act;
(d)  to enter into agreements with public agencies and other parties and
entities to provide sewage and wastewater treatment services on such terms and
conditions as it considers to be in the best interests of its participants;
and
(e)  to acquire by purchase or by exercise of the power of eminent domain, any
real or personal property in connection with the acquisition and construction
of any sewage and wastewater treatment plant and all related facilities and
rights-of-way which it owns, operates, and maintains.
(4)  The provisions of Part 3, Project Entity Provisions, do not apply to a
legal or administrative entity created for regional sewage and wastewater
treatment purposes under this section.
(5)  All proceedings previously had in connection with the creation of any
legal or administrative entity pursuant to this chapter, and all proceedings
previously had by any such entity for the authorization and issuance of bonds
of the entity are validated, ratified, and confirmed; and these entities are
declared to be validly created interlocal cooperation entities under this
chapter.  These bonds, whether previously or subsequently issued pursuant to
these proceedings, are validated, ratified, and confirmed and declared to
constitute, if previously issued, or when issued, the valid and legally
binding obligations of the entity in accordance with their terms.  Nothing in
this section shall be construed to affect or validate any bonds, or the
organization of any entity, the legality of which is being contested at the
time this act takes effect.
(6) (a)  The governing body of each party to the agreement to approve the
creation of an entity under this section shall:

67-1a-6.5; and
