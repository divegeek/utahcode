63L-3-202.   Agency actions.
(1)  Using the guidelines prepared under Section 63L-3-201, each state agency
shall:
(a)  determine whether an action has constitutional taking implications; and
(b)  prepare an assessment of constitutional taking implications that includes
an analysis of the following:
(i)  the likelihood that the action may result in a constitutional taking,
including a description of how the taking affects the use or value of private
property;
(ii)  alternatives to the proposed action that may:
(A)  fulfill the government's legal obligations of the state agency;
(B)  reduce the impact on the private property owner; and
(C)  reduce the risk of a constitutional taking; and
(iii)  an estimate of financial cost to the state for compensation and the
source of payment within the agency's budget if a constitutional taking is
determined.
(2)  In addition to the guidelines prepared under Section 63L-3-201, each
state agency shall adhere, to the extent permitted by law, to the following
criteria if implementing or enforcing actions that have constitutional taking
implications:
(a)  If an agency requires a person to obtain a permit for a specific use of
private property, any conditions imposed on issuing the permit shall directly
relate to the purpose for which the permit is issued and shall substantially
advance that purpose.
(b)  Any restriction imposed on the use of private property shall be
proportionate to the extent the use contributes to the overall problem that
the restriction is to redress.
(c)  If an action involves a permitting process or any other decision-making
process that will interfere with, or otherwise prohibit, the use of private
property pending the completion of the process, the duration of the process
shall be kept to the minimum necessary.
(d)  Before taking an action restricting private property use for the
protection of public health or safety, the state agency, in internal
deliberative documents, shall:
(i)  clearly identify, with as much specificity as possible, the public health
or safety risk created by the private property use;
(ii)  establish that the action substantially advances the purpose of
protecting public health and safety against the specifically identified risk;
(iii)  establish, to the extent possible, that the restrictions imposed on the
private property are proportionate to the extent the use contributes to the
overall risk; and
(iv)  estimate, to the extent possible, the potential cost to the government
if a court determines that the action constitutes a constitutional taking.
(3)  If there is an immediate threat to health and safety that constitutes an
emergency and requires an immediate response, the analysis required by
Subsection (2)(b) may be made when the response is completed.
(4)  Before the state agency implements an action that has constitutional
taking implications, the state agency shall submit a copy of the assessment of
constitutional taking implications to the governor and the Legislative
Management Committee.
