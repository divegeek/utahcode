(2)  A person using water in this state shall make the controlling works and measuring device accessible to the state engineer or water commissioner.

(3)  The state engineer shall approve the design of:

(4)  A person using water as an instream flow:

(a)  shall install and maintain a measuring device or stream gauging station in the section of the stream within which the instream flow is maintained; and

(b)  is not required to install controlling works unless the state engineer's order approving the application requires the installation because controlling works are necessary to achieve the purpose of the application.
