73-5-15.   Groundwater management plan.

(1)  As used in this section:

(a)  "Critical management area" means a groundwater basin in which the groundwater withdrawals consistently exceed the safe yield.

(b)  "Safe yield" means the amount of groundwater that can be withdrawn from a groundwater basin over a period of time without exceeding the long-term recharge of the basin or unreasonably affecting the basin's physical and chemical integrity.

(2) (a)  The state engineer may regulate groundwater withdrawals within a specific groundwater basin by adopting a groundwater management plan in accordance with this section for any groundwater basin or aquifer or combination of hydrologically connected groundwater basins or aquifers.

(b)  The objectives of a groundwater management plan are to:

(i)  limit groundwater withdrawals to safe yield;

(ii)  protect the physical integrity of the aquifer; and

(iii)  protect water quality.

(c)  The state engineer shall adopt a groundwater management plan for a groundwater basin if more than one-third of the water right owners in the groundwater basin request that the state engineer adopt a groundwater management plan.

(3) (a)  In developing a groundwater management plan, the state engineer may consider:

(i)  the hydrology of the groundwater basin;

(ii)  the physical characteristics of the groundwater basin;

(iii)  the relationship between surface water and groundwater, including whether the groundwater should be managed in conjunction with hydrologically connected surface waters;

(iv)  the conjunctive management of water rights to facilitate and coordinate the lease, purchase, or voluntary use of water rights subject to the groundwater management plan;

(v)  the geographic spacing and location of groundwater withdrawals;

(vi)  water quality;

(vii)  local well interference; and

(viii)  other relevant factors.

(b)  The state engineer shall base the provisions of a groundwater management plan on the principles of prior appropriation.

(c) (i)  The state engineer shall use the best available scientific method to determine safe yield.

(ii)  As hydrologic conditions change or additional information becomes available, safe yield determinations made by the state engineer may be revised by following the procedures listed in Subsection (5).

(4) (a) (i)  Except as provided in Subsection (4)(b), the withdrawal of water from a groundwater basin shall be limited to the basin's safe yield.

(ii)  Before limiting withdrawals in a groundwater basin to safe yield, the state engineer shall:

(A)  determine the groundwater basin's safe yield; and

(B)  adopt a groundwater management plan for the groundwater basin.

(iii)  If the state engineer determines that groundwater withdrawals in a groundwater basin exceed the safe yield, the state engineer shall regulate groundwater rights in that groundwater basin based on the priority date of the water rights under the groundwater management plan, unless a voluntary arrangement exists under Subsection (4)(c) that requires a different distribution.

(iv)  A groundwater management plan shall include a list of each groundwater right in the proposed groundwater management area known to the state engineer identifying the water right holder, the land to which the groundwater right is appurtenant, and any identification number the state engineer uses in the administration of water rights.

(b)  When adopting a groundwater management plan for a critical management area, the state engineer shall, based on economic and other impacts to an individual water user or a local community caused by the implementation of safe yield limits on withdrawals, allow gradual implementation of the groundwater management plan.

(c) (i)  In consultation with the state engineer, water users in a groundwater basin may agree to participate in a voluntary arrangement for managing withdrawals at any time, either before or after a determination that groundwater withdrawals exceed the groundwater basin's safe yield.

(ii)  A voluntary arrangement under Subsection (4)(c)(i) shall be consistent with other law.

(iii)  The adoption of a voluntary arrangement under this Subsection (4)(c) by less than all of the water users in a groundwater basin does not affect the rights of water users who do not agree to the voluntary arrangement.

(5)  To adopt a groundwater management plan, the state engineer shall:

(a)  give notice as specified in Subsection (7) at least 30 days before the first public meeting held in accordance with Subsection (5)(b):

(i)  that the state engineer proposes to adopt a groundwater management plan;

(ii)  describing generally the land area proposed to be included in the groundwater management plan; and

(iii)  stating the location, date, and time of each public meeting to be held in accordance with Subsection (5)(b);

(b)  hold one or more public meetings in the geographic area proposed to be included within the groundwater management plan to:

(i)  address the need for a groundwater management plan;

(ii)  present any data, studies, or reports that the state engineer intends to consider in preparing the groundwater management plan;

(iii)  address safe yield and any other subject that may be included in the groundwater management plan;

(iv)  outline the estimated administrative costs, if any, that groundwater users are likely to incur if the plan is adopted; and

(v)  receive any public comments and other information presented at the public meeting, including comments from any of the entities listed in Subsection (7)(a)(iii);

(c)  receive and consider written comments concerning the proposed groundwater management plan from any person for a period determined by the state engineer of not less than 60 days after the day on which the notice required by Subsection (5)(a) is given;

(d) (i)  at least 60 days prior to final adoption of the groundwater management plan, publish notice:

(A)  that a draft of the groundwater management plan has been proposed; and

(B)  specifying where a copy of the draft plan may be reviewed; and

(ii)  promptly provide a copy of the draft plan in printed or electronic form to each of the entities listed in Subsection (7)(a)(iii) that makes written request for a copy; and

(e)  provide notice of the adoption of the groundwater management plan.

(6)  A groundwater management plan shall become effective on the date notice of adoption is completed under Subsection (7), or on a later date if specified in the plan.

(7) (a)  A notice required by this section shall be:

(i)  published:

(A)  once a week for two successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in each county that encompasses a portion of the land area proposed to be included within the groundwater management plan; and

(B)  in accordance with Section 45-1-101 for two weeks;
