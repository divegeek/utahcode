Whenever any applicant for the use of water from any stream or water source must necessarily enter upon private property in order to make a survey to secure the required information for making a water filing and is refused by the owner or possessor of such property such right of entry, he may petition the district court for an order granting such right, and after notice and hearing, such court may grant such permission, on security being given to pay all damage caused thereby to the owner of such property. In such case the priority of such application shall date from the filing of such petition with the district court as aforesaid.
