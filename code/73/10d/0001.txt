73-10d-1.   Public policy.
The Legislature declares that the policy of this state is to assure its
citizens adequate public services, including drinking water, water, and
wastewater collection, treatment and disposal at reasonable cost.   Adequate
public services are essential to the maintenance and general welfare of the
citizens of this state and to the continued expansion of the state's economy,
job market, and industrial base.
The cost of constructing, owning, and operating capital facilities to meet the
anticipated growth in the demand for those public services is becoming
increasingly burdensome to political subdivisions, particularly to the smaller
communities of the state.
It is desirable that innovative financing mechanisms be made available to
assist the communities of this state to develop capital facilities to provide
adequate public services at reasonable cost.  Private sector ownership and
operation of capital facilities providing public services together with
industrial development revenue bond financing of those facilities, can result
in cost savings to communities contracting for those public services.
It is in the best public interest of the state and its citizens that
political subdivisions be authorized to provide public services by access to
facilities owned and operated by private persons and financed through the
issuance of industrial development revenue bonds, and to contract with private
persons for the long-term provision of the services of those facilities.
