73-10d-6.   Contents of agreements and reports required where bonds are
issued that mature more than 10 years after project begins operation.
(1)  If a municipality or county issues bonds to finance the cost of a
privatization project and the bonds mature more than 10 years after the
privatization project begins operation, the political subdivision contracting
with a private owner/operator for the services of the privatization project
shall assure that the minimum level of services under contract, payment for
the services, and the supply of drinking water, water, or wastewater required
in connection with the provision of those services will be sufficient to
generate enough income, after payment of operating expenses, to fund reserves
for repair and replacement, and to discharge any other obligation of the
political subdivision to the private owner/operator under any agreement, and
together with all other sources of revenue pledged for payment of the bonds,
to pay all principal and interest on the bonds during the term of the bonded
indebtedness.  The assurance may take the form of:
(a)  long-term agreements, at least equal to the period of the bonded
indebtedness, with other  political subdivisions or other persons; or
(b)  ordinances, franchises, or other forms of regulation requiring sufficient
quantities of drinking water, water, or wastewater.
(2)  The supervising agency shall establish rules for periodic reporting by
any political subdivision that establishes ordinances, franchises, or other
forms of regulation under Subsection (1) and Subsection 73-10d-4(3).  The
reports shall include information about the services being provided by the
privatization project and whether the charges made for those services together
with all other sources of revenue pledged for the payment of principal and
interest on the bonds, are sufficient to meet the debt service on the bonds.
