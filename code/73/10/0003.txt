The board shall elect a chairman, one or more vice-chairmen, who shall be members of the board, and shall establish its own rules of organization and procedure.

The board, with the approval of the executive director of natural resources and the governor, shall designate a representative who may be one of its members to represent the state of Utah in all interstate conferences between the state of Utah and one or more sister states held for the purpose of entering into compacts between such states for the division of the waters of interstate rivers, lakes, or other sources of water supply, and to represent the state of Utah upon all commissions or other governing bodies provided for by any compacts which have been or may hereafter be entered into between the state of Utah and one or more sister states.

In acting as such representative of the state of Utah, the representative so acting shall act under the supervision of the governor, through the executive director of natural resources and of the Board of Water Resources.  The director of the Division of Finance shall fix the salary to be paid to the representative while he is acting in this capacity.
