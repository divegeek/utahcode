73-18a-10.   Enforcement -- Inspection of vessels, marinas, and other boating facilities.

Enforcement of this chapter or the rules promulgated under it shall be by law enforcement officers. Any vessel in this state is subject to inspection by the officers for the purpose of determining whether the vessel is equipped in compliance with this chapter.  If the vessel is not so equipped, the division may suspend its registration until the proper installation is completed or the marine toilet is sealed in a manner which prohibits its use.  The division may inspect marinas or other waterside public facilities used by vessels for launching, docking, or mooring purposes to determine whether they are adequately equipped for proper handling, storing, or disposal of waste, litter, or human body waste.
