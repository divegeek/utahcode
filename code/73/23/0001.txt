73-23-1.   Legislative findings.

(1)  The Legislature finds that the level of the Great Salt Lake has risen sharply in recent years due to extreme weather conditions.  The high level of the lake has caused extraordinary flooding conditions resulting in substantial damage to public and private facilities.  Those conditions pose a threat to life, health, and property, and in particular may result in extensive damage to public lands, major transportation routes, and other public facilities.

(2)  The Legislature finds that some of the existing and anticipated extraordinary flooding conditions can be alleviated by construction of the West Desert Pumping Project.

(3)  The Legislature declares it is in the public interest and a public purpose to construct the West Desert Pumping Project as a means of counteracting the threat to life, health, and property in general and to public lands, major transportation routes, and other public facilities in particular.

(4)  The Legislature finds that all activities engaged in under authority of this chapter are governmental functions and governmental entities and their officers and employees are immune from suit for any injury or damage resulting from those activities.
