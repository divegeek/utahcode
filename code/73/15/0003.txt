Water Resources -- Powers and authority of division -- "Cloud seeding" and
"cloud-seeding project" defined.
The state of Utah through the Division of Water Resources shall be the only
entity, private or public, that shall have authority to authorize cloud-
seeding research, evaluation, or implementation projects to alter
precipitation, cloud forms, or meteorological parameters within the state of
Utah, except cloud seeding for the suppression of fog; and frost prevention
measures for the protection of orchards and crops are excluded from the
coverage of this act. The Division of Water Resources shall authorize and may
sponsor or develop local or state-wide cloud-seeding projects that conform to
over-all state water planning objectives and are determined to be feasible by
the Division of Water Resources. The Division of Water Resources may contract
with the Utah water research laboratory or any other individual or
organization for consultation and/or assistance in developing cloud-seeding
projects or in furthering necessary research of cloud seeding or other factors
that may be affected by cloud-seeding activities. Cloud seeding as used in
this act shall be construed to mean all acts undertaken to artificially
distribute or create nuclei in cloud masses for the purposes of altering
precipitation, cloud forms, or other meteorological parameters. A cloud-
seeding project as used in this act shall be a planned project to evaluate
meteorological conditions, perform cloud seeding, and evaluate results.
