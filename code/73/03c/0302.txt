(d)  the estimated quantity of water to be reused;

(e)  the location of the POTW;

(f)  the place, purpose, and extent of the proposed water reuse;

(g)  an evaluation of depletion from the hydrologic system caused by the water reuse; and

(a)  the use of the reuse water does not enlarge the underlying water right; and

(b)  any return flow requirement of the underlying water right is satisfied.

(6) (a)  The state engineer shall approve a water reuse application if the state engineer concludes that the proposed water reuse is consistent with the underlying water right.

(b)  The state engineer may:

(i)  deny an application for water reuse if the proposed water reuse is inconsistent with the underlying water right; or

(ii)  approve the application in part or with conditions to assure consistency with the underlying water right.

(7)  A public agency with an approved reuse application shall submit a report, as directed by the state engineer, concerning the ongoing water reuse operation.
