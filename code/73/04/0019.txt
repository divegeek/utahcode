73-4-19.   Redetermination -- Bond of applicant.
Wherever a general determination of water rights upon any river system or
water source has been made by the district court, any claimant to the use of
water from such river system or water source seeking a redetermination of
water rights upon such river system or water source shall, before commencing
any action for such redetermination or for the revision of any final judgment
other than as provided in Section 73-4-1, furnish to the court in which such
action is commenced and before the filing of any petition or complaint for
such purpose, a good and sufficient bond, in a form and with sureties approved
by the court, in a sum fixed by the court at least equal to twice the
estimated costs which may arise in such action, conditioned that if final
judgment after hearing, or after appeal should appeal be taken, is awarded
against such claimant, then such claimant will pay all costs arising in such
action and all damages to other parties thereto arising therefrom.
