It is the intent of the Legislature that the money appropriated into the Water Development and Flood Mitigation Reserve Account in Section 73-10e-1 may not be spent for construction of dikes until all necessary rights-of-way and easements are obtained for each individual diking project by the impacted local government entities in which the diking projects are located.
