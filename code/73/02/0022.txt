73-2-22.   Emergency flood powers -- Action to enforce orders -- Access
rights to private and public property -- Injunctive relief against state
engineer's decisions -- Judicial review provisions not applicable.
Whenever the state engineer, with approval of the chairman of the Disaster
Emergency Advisory Council, makes a written finding that any reservoir or
stream has reached or will reach during the current water year a level far
enough above average and in excess of capacity that public safety is or is
likely to be endangered or that substantial property damage is occurring or is
likely to occur, he shall have emergency powers until the danger to the public
and property is abated. Emergency powers shall consist of the authority to
control stream flow and reservoir storage or release. The state engineer must
protect existing water rights to the maximum extent possible when exercising
emergency powers. Any action taken by the state engineer under this section
shall be by written order.
If any person refuses or neglects to comply with any order of the state
engineer issued pursuant to his emergency powers, the state engineer may bring
action in the name of the state in the district court to enforce them. In
carrying out his emergency powers, the state engineer shall have rights of
access to private and public property.
Any person affected by a decision of the state engineer made under his
emergency powers shall have the right to seek injunctive relief, including
temporary restraining orders and temporary injunctions in any district court
of the county where that person resides. No order of the state engineer shall
be enjoined or set aside unless shown by clear and convincing evidence that an
emergency does not in fact exist or that the order of the state engineer is
arbitrary or capricious. The provisions of Sections 73-3-14 and 73-3-15 shall
not be applicable to any order of the state engineer issued pursuant to this
section.
