(1)  The division may, upon the application of any person, issue a certificate
of self-funded coverage when it is satisfied that the person has:
(a)  more than 24 motorboats; and
(b)  on deposit, in a form approved by the division, cash or securities in an
amount of $200,000 plus $100 for each motorboat up to and including 1,000
motorboats and $50 for each motorboat over 1,000 motorboats.
(2)  Persons holding a certificate of self-funded coverage under this chapter
shall pay benefits to persons injured from the self-funded person's operation,
maintenance, and use of motorboats as would an insurer issuing a policy to the
self-funded person containing the coverages under Sections 31A-22-1502 and
31A-22-1503.
(3)  In accordance with Title 63G, Chapter 4, Administrative Procedures Act,
the division may, upon reasonable grounds, cancel the certificate.  Failure to

days after the judgment is final is a reasonable ground to cancel the
certificate.

motorboats under Title 63G, Chapter 7, Governmental Immunity Act of Utah,
meets the requirements of this section.
