(I)  is eligible to receive for a week as of the first day the employee is eligible to receive a Social Security death benefit; and

(II)  receives.

(B)  An employer or its insurance carrier may not reduce compensation payable under this Subsection (5)(b)(iii) on or after May 5, 2008, to a wholly dependent person by an amount related to a cost-of-living increase to the Social Security death benefits that the wholly dependent person is first eligible to receive for a week, notwithstanding whether the employee is injured on or before May 4, 2008.
