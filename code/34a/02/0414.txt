(i)  dividing the amount of benefits by the number of dependents; and

(ii)  allotting each dependent an equal share.

(c)  If one or more of the dependents described in Subsection (1)(a) is partly dependent, the commission may apportion the benefits in a manner different than Subsection (1)(b).

(2) A dependent or a person to whom a benefit is paid for a dependent, shall apply the benefit to the use of the one or more beneficiaries.

(3)  In all cases of death, if:

(a)  the dependents are a surviving spouse and one or more minor children, it is sufficient for the surviving spouse to apply for benefits on behalf of the surviving spouse and the minor children; and

(b)  all of the dependents are minor children, a guardian or next friend of the minor dependents shall apply for the benefits. 

(4) (a)  An administrative law judge may, for the purpose of protecting the rights and interests of a minor dependent who does not have a surviving parent or court appointed custodian or guardian, direct that the benefits be deposited into an interest bearing account for the purpose of receiving a payment due the minor dependent.

(b)  Money deposited into an interest bearing account under Subsection (4)(a) shall be released to:
