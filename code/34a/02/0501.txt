(1)  "Harmful industrial noise" means:
(a)  sound that results in acoustic trauma such as sudden instantaneous
temporary noise or impulsive or impact noise exceeding 140 dB peak sound
pressure levels; or
(b)  the sound emanating from equipment and machines during employment
exceeding the following permissible sound levels, dBA slow response, and
corresponding durations per day, in hours:
     Sound level                              Duration
90                                      8

115                                     0.25 or less
(2)  "Loss of hearing" means binaural hearing loss measured in decibels with
frequencies of 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 3,000 cycles per second (Hertz).  If the
average decibel loss at 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 3,000 cycles per second (Hertz)
is 25 decibels or less, usually no hearing impairment exists.
