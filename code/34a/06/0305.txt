34A-6-305.   Injunction proceedings.
(1)  The district courts shall have jurisdiction, upon petition of the
administrator to restrain any conditions or practices in any place of
employment where danger exists which could reasonably be expected to cause
death or physical harm immediately or before the imminence of such danger can
be eliminated through enforcement procedures provided by this chapter.  Any
order issued under this section may require that necessary steps be taken to
avoid, correct, or remove imminent danger or prohibit the employment or
presence of any individual in locations or under conditions where imminent
danger exists, except individuals whose presence is necessary to avoid,
correct, or remove imminent danger or maintain the capacity of a continuous
process operation so that normal operations can be resumed without a complete
cessation of operations, or where cessation of operations is necessary, to
permit such to be accomplished in a safe and orderly manner.
(2)  The district courts shall have jurisdiction upon petition to grant
injunctive relief or temporary restraining orders pending the outcome of any
enforcement proceeding pursuant to this act pursuant to Rule 65A, Utah Rules
of Civil Procedure; provided, that no temporary restraining order issued
without notice shall be effective for more than five days.
(3)  Whenever an inspector concludes that imminent danger exists in any place
of employment, the inspector shall inform the affected employees and employers
of the danger and that the inspector is recommending to the administrator that
relief be sought.
(4)  If the administrator arbitrarily or capriciously fails to seek relief
under this section, any employee who may be injured by reason of such failure,
or the representative of such employees, may bring an action against the
administrator in the district court of the county in which the imminent danger
is alleged to exist or the employer has its principal office, for a writ of
mandamus and for further appropriate relief.
