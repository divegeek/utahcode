67-3-2.   Right to compel accounting by, and state accounts with, all
collectors of state money -- Escheats.
Whenever any person has received money, or has money or other personal
property which belongs to the state by escheat or otherwise, or has been
entrusted with the collection, management or disbursement of any money, bonds,
or interest accruing thereon, belonging to or held in trust by the state, and
fails to render an account thereof to and make settlement with the state
auditor within the time prescribed by law, or, when no particular time is
specified, fails to render such account and make settlement, or who fails to
pay into the state treasury any money belonging to the state, upon being
required so to do by the state auditor, within 20 days after such requisition,
the state auditor must state an account with such person, charging 25%
damages, and interest at the rate of 10% per annum from the time of failure; a
copy of such account in any suit thereon shall be prima facie evidence of the
things therein stated. In case the state auditor cannot, for want of
information, state such an account, he may in any action brought by him aver
the fact, and allege generally the amount of money or other property which is
due to or which belongs to the state.
