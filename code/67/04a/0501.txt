(b)  The administrator may give notice by:

(i)  mailing notice to the last address, if any, stated in the claim as the address to which notices are to be sent; or

(ii)  if no address for notices is stated in the claim, the notice may be mailed to the last address, if any, of the claimant as stated in the claim.
