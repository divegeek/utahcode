services performed, if (1) the agency so billed receives federal funds to pay
for the legal services rendered, or if (2) the agency collects funds from any
other source in the form of fees, costs, interest, fines, penalties,
forfeitures, or other proceeds reserved or designated for the payment of legal
fees sufficient to pay for all or a portion of the legal services rendered;
however, the agency may deduct any unreimbursed costs and expenses incurred by
the agency in connection with the legal services rendered. As used in this act
