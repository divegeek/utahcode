67-5-9.   Reassignment of career status employees -- Additional compensation for managerial assignments -- Employment of special assistant attorneys general -- Termination of employees -- Salary increases.

This chapter does not affect the authority of the attorney general to:

(1)  assign and reassign employees in a career status to different positions on his staff.  The salary of an employee reassigned to a different position shall not be decreased by reason of reassignment; except that if the employee reassigned occupies the position of chief deputy attorney general, the salary may be reduced by not more than 15% upon the assignment to a different position;

(2)  develop a plan for additional compensation for career status employees who accept managerial assignments within the office.  The provisions of Subsection (1) notwithstanding, the attorney general may discontinue any additional compensation if the employee no longer holds a managerial assignment.  Additional compensation provided under this section shall be determined by the attorney general pursuant to the plan developed by the Office of the Attorney General. If the employee no longer holds a managerial assignment, and the attorney general decides to discontinue any additional compensation, the reduction may not place the employee at a salary below where the employee would be through normal salary increases if the employee had not been in a managerial position;

(3)  employ special assistant attorneys general, who shall not be subject to this chapter, to represent the state in particular lawsuits or to handle particular legal matters for the state;

(4)  terminate the employment of any employee of the Office of the Attorney General who is not in a career service status; or

(5)  establish the salary or determine salary increases of any employee under this chapter.
