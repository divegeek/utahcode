The county clerk of any county which has adopted this act shall issue a marriage license to those applicants who come within the premarital counseling  requirements of this act when the applicants present a certificate from the premarital counseling board that the counseling has been completed or has been found to be adequate if the license application otherwise conforms to the requirements for issuance of a marriage license. For those applicants who would otherwise need approval of the district court in order to marry, the certificate shall take the place of court consent if the parents, guardian or custodial parent of the applicant have given their consent to the marriage.
