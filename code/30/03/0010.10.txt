(1)  In any proceeding regarding a parenting plan, the court shall consider evidence of domestic violence, if presented.

The parent who is the stated victim in the order or injunction may submit to the court, and the court shall consider, the name of a person considered suitable to act as the third party.

(4)  If the court orders the parents to conduct parent-time through a third party, the parenting plan shall specify the time, day, place, manner, and the third party to be used to implement the exchange.
