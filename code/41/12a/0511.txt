41-12a-511.   Failure to satisfy judgment.
(1)  Whenever any person fails within 60 days to satisfy any judgment, it is
the duty of the clerk of the court or of the judge of a court which has no
clerk in which any such judgment is rendered in Utah, upon the written request
of the judgment creditor or his attorney, to forward to the department
immediately after the expiration of the 60 days, a certified copy of the
judgment.
(2)  The department, upon the receipt of a certified copy of a judgment, shall
suspend the license and registration and any nonresident's operating privilege
of any person against whom the judgment was rendered, except as provided in
Subsection (5) and Section 41-12a-513.
(3)  Except as provided under Subsection (5) and Section 41-12a-513, a
license, registration, and nonresident's operating privilege suspended under
Subsection (2) remains suspended and may not be renewed nor may that license
or registration be thereafter issued in the name of the same person, including
a person not previously licensed, unless every such judgment is stayed or
satisfied in full within the meaning of Section 41-12a-512, and until the
person files proof of owner's or operator's security.
(4)  If the judgment debtor named in any certified copy of a judgment reported
to the department is a nonresident, the department shall transmit a certified
copy of the judgment to the official in charge of the issuance of licenses and
registration certificates of the state of which the judgment debtor is a
resident.
(5)  If the judgment creditor consents in writing, in a form the department
prescribes, that the judgment debtor be allowed license and registration or
nonresident's operating privilege, they may be allowed by the department for
six months from the date of the consent and thereafter until that consent is
revoked in writing, notwithstanding the default in the payment of the judgment
or of any installments thereof prescribed in Section 41-12a-513, if the
judgment debtor furnishes proof of owner's security.
