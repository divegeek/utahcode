41-12a-104.   Rules of construction.
(1)  If a person maintains owner's security under this chapter, it does not
limit his liability to the face amount of the owner's security.
(2)  Nothing in this chapter prevents the plaintiff in any action at law from
relying for relief upon the other processes provided by law.
(3)  This chapter is cumulative with the requirements of the laws of this
state requiring policies of motor vehicle insurance against liability.   This
subsection does not preclude compliance through a single policy which, by its
terms or by an appropriate endorsement, satisfies the requirements of both
applicable laws.
