41-12a-508.   Form and amount of post-accident security.
(1)  The post-accident security required under Subsection 41-12a-501(1) shall
be in the form of cash, cashier's check, a national or Utah bank's clean and
irrevocable letter of credit, or the assignment of a bank's certificate of
deposit.  The department may not require a deposit in excess of the minimum
single limit under Subsection 31A-22-304(2).  The person depositing security
shall specify in a manner specified by the department the persons on whose
behalf the deposit is made and may, at any time while the deposit is in the
custody of the department or state treasurer, in a manner specified by the
department amend the specification of the persons on whose behalf the deposit
is made.  However, a single deposit of security is applicable only on behalf
of persons required to furnish security because of the same accident.
(2)  Subject to Subsection (1), the department may alter the amount of post-
accident security required if, in its judgment, the amount previously ordered
is excessive or inadequate.  If the security originally ordered is determined
to be excessive, the excess deposited over the reduced amount ordered shall be
returned to the depositor or his personal representative as soon as possible,
notwithstanding the provisions of Section 41-12a-509.  If the security
originally ordered is determined to be inadequate, the depositor may be
required to increase the deposit within 20 days or be subject to the penalties
under Subsection 41-12a-501(3).
