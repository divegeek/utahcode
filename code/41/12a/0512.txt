41-12a-512.   When judgments deemed satisfied.
Judgments arising from a single accident which in the aggregate are in excess
of the minimum single limit under Subsection 31A-22-304(2) shall be considered
satisfied in full, for the purpose of this chapter only, when payments equal
to that limit have been credited to the judgment.  Payments made by the
judgment debtor prior to the judgment, but on the claim which arose out of the
bodily injury, death, or property damage caused by a motor vehicle accident
shall be credited in reduction of the amount necessary for the judgment to be
considered satisfied in full for purposes of this chapter.  If multiple
judgments against a depositor of post-accident security arise out of the same
accident, and in the aggregate the several claims exceed the amount deposited,
then the deposit shall be distributed pro rata, based upon each judgment
creditor's portion of the total judgments arising from the accident.  Any
punitive or exemplary damages awarded a judgment creditor may not be
considered in determining the claimant's pro rata share.
