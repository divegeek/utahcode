(b)  The division upon a proper showing shall register the vehicle in this state.

(2) (a)  If a person is relocating from another jurisdiction and establishing residence in this state, whether temporary or permanent, and that person has a vehicle registered and titled in another jurisdiction and is not able to surrender title to the vehicle being registered in Utah because title is physically held by a lienholder, the  division may register the vehicle without issuing a Utah title.
