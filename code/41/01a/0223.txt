(1) (a)  If the owner of a vehicle operating interstate and registered in
another state desires to retain registration of the vehicle in the other
state, the applicant need not surrender but shall submit for inspection
evidences of out-of-state registration.
(b)  The division upon a proper showing shall register the vehicle in this
state.
(2) (a)  If a person is relocating from another jurisdiction and establishing
residence in this state, whether temporary or permanent, and that person has a
vehicle registered and titled in another jurisdiction and is not able to
surrender title to the vehicle being registered in Utah because title is
physically held by a lienholder, the  division may register the vehicle
without issuing a Utah title.
