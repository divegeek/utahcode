fee.
(1)  If a dealer licensed under this chapter sells a third party warranty or
service contract to a customer, the dealer shall within 15 days remit the fee
paid by the customer to the warranty or service contract company.

dealer license suspension and allows the customer a cause of action against
the dealer for damages that otherwise would have been covered by the warranty
or service contract.
