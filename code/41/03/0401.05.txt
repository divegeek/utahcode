THE PRIMARY TERMS OF THE FINANCING ARRANGEMENT ARE TO BE AS FOLLOWS:

TERM BETWEEN _____ MONTHS AND ______ MONTHS.  MONTHLY PAYMENTS BETWEEN $______ PER MONTH AND $ _____ PER MONTH BASED ON A DOWN PAYMENT AND/OR NET TRADE-IN ALLOWANCE OF $ _________.

(2) (a)  IF THE DEALER IS NOT ABLE TO SECURE FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS WITHIN THE TERMS DISCLOSED, THEN THE DEALER MUST WITHIN SEVEN CALENDAR DAYS OF THE DATE OF THE CONTRACT TO ENTER INTO A LEASE AGREEMENT MAIL NOTICE TO THE PROSPECTIVE LESSEE THAT THE DEALER HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO SECURE FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DISCLOSED TERMS AND THE CONTRACT TO ENTER INTO A LEASE AGREEMENT IS THEREFORE RESCINDED.

(b)  IF THE DEALER IS NOT ABLE TO SECURE FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS WITHIN THE TERMS DISCLOSED, SUCH FAILURE DOES NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRE THE DEALER TO PROVIDE THE FINANCING NECESSARY FOR THE PROSPECTIVE LESSEE TO LEASE THE VEHICLE.

(c)  IF THE CONTRACT TO ENTER INTO A LEASE AGREEMENT IS RESCINDED, THE PROSPECTIVE LESSEE HAS 48 HOURS FROM RECEIPT OF THE NOTICE TO:

(i)  RETURN TO THE DEALER THE MOTOR VEHICLE THE PROSPECTIVE LESSEE AGREED TO LEASE;

(iii)  COMPENSATE THE DEALER FOR ANY PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO THE MOTOR VEHICLE WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS IN THE PROSPECTIVE LESSEE'S POSSESSION.

(3)  IN RETURN, UPON RECEIPT OF THE ITEMS SET FORTH IN (2)(c)(i), (ii), and (iii) THE DEALER SHALL RETURN TO THE PROSPECTIVE LESSEE ALL PAYMENTS OR OTHER CONSIDERATION PAID BY THE PROSPECTIVE LESSEE, INCLUDING ANY DOWN PAYMENT AND ANY MOTOR VEHICLE TRADED IN.

(4)  IF THE TRADE-IN HAS BEEN SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF BEFORE THE CONTRACT TO ENTER INTO A LEASE AGREEMENT IS RESCINDED, THEN THE DEALER SHALL RETURN TO THE PROSPECTIVE LESSEE A SUM EQUIVALENT TO THE ALLOWANCE TOWARD THE LEASE PRICE GIVEN BY THE DEALER FOR THE TRADE-IN, AS NOTED IN THE CONTRACT TO ENTER INTO A LEASE AGREEMENT.
