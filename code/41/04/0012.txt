41-4-12.   Actions for damages.

In addition to the criminal and civil penalties herein provided, any person who is injured in his business or property by any other person or corporation or association or partnership, by reason of anything forbidden or declared to be unlawful by this act, may sue therefor in any court having jurisdiction thereof in the county where the defendant resides or is found, or any agent resides or is found, or where service may be obtained, without respect to the amount in controversy, and to recover twofold the damages by him sustained, and the costs of suit. Whenever it shall appear to the court before which any proceeding under this act is pending, that the ends of justice require that other parties shall be brought before the court, the court may cause them to be made parties defendant and summoned, whether they reside in the county where such action is pending, or not.
