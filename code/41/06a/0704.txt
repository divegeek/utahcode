41-6a-704.   Overtaking and passing vehicles proceeding in same direction.
(1) (a)  On any highway:
(i)  the operator of a vehicle overtaking another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction shall:
(A)  except as provided under Section 41-6a-705, promptly pass the overtaken
vehicle on the left at a safe distance; and
(B) enter a right-hand lane or the right side of the roadway only when safely
clear of the overtaken vehicle;
(ii)  the operator of an overtaken vehicle:
(A)  shall give way to the right in favor of the overtaking vehicle; and
(B)  may not increase the speed of the vehicle until completely passed by the
overtaking vehicle.
(b)  The exemption from the minimum speed regulations for a vehicle operating
on a grade under Section 41-6a-605 does not exempt the vehicle from promptly
passing a vehicle as required under Subsection (1)(a)(i)(A).
(2)  On a highway having more than one lane in the same direction, the
operator of a vehicle traveling in the left general purpose lane:
(a)  shall, upon being overtaken by another vehicle in the same lane, yield to
the overtaking vehicle by moving safely to a lane to the right; and
(b)  may not impede the movement or free flow of traffic in the left general
purpose lane.
(3)  An operator of a vehicle traveling in the left general purpose lane that
has a vehicle following directly behind the operator's vehicle at a distance
so that less than two seconds elapse before reaching the location of the
operator's vehicle when space is available for the operator to yield to the
overtaking vehicle by traveling in the right-hand lane is prima facie evidence
that the operator is violating Subsection (2).
(4)  The provisions of Subsection (2) do not apply to an operator of a vehicle
traveling in the left general purpose lane when:
(a)  overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same direction
in accordance with Subsection (1)(a)(i);
(b)  preparing to turn left or taking a different highway or an exit on the
left;
(c)  responding to emergency conditions;
(d)  avoiding actual or potential traffic moving onto the highway from an
acceleration or merging lane; or
(e)  following the direction of a traffic-control device that directs the use
of a designated lane.
