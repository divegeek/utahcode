17B-1-511.   Continuation of tax levy after withdrawal to pay for
proportionate share of district bonds.
(1)  Other than as provided in Subsection (2), and unless an escrow trust fund
is established and funded pursuant to Subsection 17B-1-510(5)(j), property
within the withdrawn area shall continue after withdrawal to be subject to a
tax by the local district:
(a)  for the purpose of paying the withdrawn area's just proportion of the
local district's general obligation bonds, other than those bonds treated as
revenue bonds under Subsection 17B-1-510(5)(i), until the bonded indebtedness
has been satisfied; and
(b)  to the extent and for the years necessary to generate sufficient revenue
that, when combined with the revenues from the district remaining after
withdrawal, is sufficient to provide for the payment of principal and interest
on the district's general obligation bonds that are treated as revenue bonds
under Subsection 17B-1-510(5)(i).
(2)  For a local district funded predominately by revenues other than property
taxes, service charges, or assessments based upon an allotment of acre-feet of
water, taxes within the withdrawn area shall continue to be collected for
purposes of paying the withdrawn area's proportionate share of bonded
indebtedness or judgments against the local district incurred prior to the
date the petition was filed.
(3)  Except as provided in Subsections (1) and (2), upon withdrawal, the
withdrawing area is relieved of all other taxes, assessments, and charges
levied by the district, including taxes and charges for the payment of revenue
bonds and maintenance and operation cost of the local district.
