approval or rejection -- Terms and conditions.
(1) (a)  On or before the date of the board meeting next following the public
hearing under Section 17B-1-508, but in no case later than 90 days after the
public hearing or, if no hearing is held, within 90 days after the filing of a
petition under Section 17B-1-504, the board of trustees of the local district
in which the area proposed to be withdrawn is located shall adopt a
resolution:
(i)  approving the withdrawal of some or all of the area from the local
district; or
(ii)  rejecting the withdrawal.
(b)  Each resolution approving a withdrawal shall:
(i)  include a legal description of the area proposed to be withdrawn;
(ii)  state the effective date of the withdrawal; and
(iii)  set forth the terms and conditions under Subsection (5), if any, of the
withdrawal.
(c)  Each resolution rejecting a withdrawal shall include a detailed
explanation of the board of trustees' reasons for the rejection.
(2)  Unless denial of the petition is required under Subsection (3), the board
of trustees shall adopt a resolution approving the withdrawal of some or all
of the area from the local district if the board of trustees determines that:
(a)  the area to be withdrawn does not and will not require the service that
the local district provides;
(b)  the local district will not be able to provide service to the area to be
withdrawn for the reasonably foreseeable future; or
(c)  the area to be withdrawn has obtained the same service that is provided
by the local district or a commitment to provide the same service that is
provided by the local district from another source.
(3)  The board of trustees shall adopt a resolution denying the withdrawal if
it determines that the proposed withdrawal would:
(a)  result in a breach or default by the local district under:
(i)  any of its notes, bonds, or other debt or revenue obligations;
(ii)  any of its agreements with entities which have insured, guaranteed, or
otherwise credit-enhanced any debt or revenue obligations of the local
district; or
(iii)  any of its agreements with the United States or any agency of the
United States; provided, however, that, if the local district has entered into
an agreement with the United States that requires the consent of the United
States for a withdrawal of territory from the district, a withdrawal under
this part may occur if the written consent of the United States is obtained
and filed with the board of trustees;
(b)  adversely affect the ability of the local district to make any payments
or perform any other material obligations under:
(i)  any of its agreements with the United States or any agency of the United
States;
(ii)  any of its notes, bonds, or other debt or revenue obligations; or
(iii)  any of its agreements with entities which have insured, guaranteed, or
otherwise credit-enhanced any debt or revenue obligations of the local
district;
(c)  result in the reduction or withdrawal of any rating on an outstanding
note, bond, or other debt or revenue obligation of the local district;
(d)  create an island or peninsula of nondistrict territory within the local
district or of district territory within nondistrict territory that has a
material adverse affect on the local district's ability to provide service or
materially increases the cost of providing service to the remainder of the
local district;
(e)  materially impair the operations of the remaining local district; or
(f)  require the local district to materially increase the fees it charges or
property taxes or other taxes it levies in order to provide to the remainder
of the district the same level and quality of service that was provided before
the withdrawal.
(4)  In determining whether the withdrawal would have any of the results
described in Subsection (3), the board of trustees may consider the cumulative
impact that multiple withdrawals over a specified period of time would have on
the local district.
(5) (a)  Despite the presence of one or more of the conditions listed in
Subsection (3), the board of trustees may approve a resolution withdrawing an
area from the local district imposing terms or conditions that mitigate or
eliminate the conditions listed in Subsection (3), including:
(i)  a requirement that the owners of property located within the area
proposed to be withdrawn or residents within that area pay their proportionate
share of any outstanding district bond or other obligation as determined
pursuant to Subsection (5)(b);
(ii)  a requirement that the owners of property located within the area
proposed to be withdrawn or residents within that area make one or more
payments in lieu of taxes, fees, or assessments;
(iii)  a requirement that the board of trustees and the receiving entity agree
to reasonable payment and other terms in accordance with Subsections (5)(f)
through (g) regarding the transfer to the receiving entity of district assets
that the district used before withdrawal to provide service to the withdrawn
area but no longer needs because of the withdrawal; provided that, if those
district assets are allocated in accordance with Subsections (5)(f) through
(g), the district shall immediately transfer to the receiving entity on the
effective date of the withdrawal, all title to and possession of district
assets allocated to the receiving entity; or
(iv)  any other reasonable requirement considered to be necessary by the board
of trustees.
(b)  Other than as provided for in Subsection 17B-1-511(2), and except as
provided in Subsection (5)(e), in determining the proportionate share of
outstanding bonded indebtedness or other obligations under Subsection
(5)(a)(i) and for purposes of determining the allocation and transfer of
district assets under Subsection (5)(a)(iii), the board of trustees and the
receiving entity, or in cases where there is no receiving entity, the board
and the sponsors of the petition shall:
(i)  engage engineering and accounting consultants chosen by the procedure
provided in Subsection (5)(d); provided however, that if the withdrawn area is
not receiving service, an engineering consultant need not be engaged; and
(ii)  require the engineering and accounting consultants engaged under
Subsection (5)(b)(i) to communicate in writing to the board of trustees and
the receiving entity, or in cases where there is no receiving entity, the
board and the sponsors of the petition the information required by Subsections
(5)(f) through (h).
(c)  For purposes of this Subsection (5):
(i)  "accounting consultant" means a certified public accountant or a firm of
certified public accountants with the expertise necessary to make the
determinations required under Subsection (5)(h); and
(ii)  "engineering consultant" means a person or firm that has the expertise
in the engineering aspects of the type of system by which the withdrawn area
is receiving service that is necessary to make the determination required
under Subsections (5)(f) and (g).
(d) (i)  Unless the board of trustees and the receiving entity, or in cases
where there is no receiving entity, the board and the sponsors of the petition
agree on an engineering consultant and an accounting consultant, each
consultant shall be chosen from a list of consultants provided by the
Consulting Engineers Council of Utah and the Utah Association of Certified
Public Accountants, respectively, as provided in this Subsection (5)(d).
(ii)  A list under Subsection (5)(d)(i) may not include a consultant who has
had a contract for services with the district or the receiving entity during
the two-year period immediately before the list is provided to the local
district.
(iii)  Within 20 days of receiving the lists described in Subsection
(5)(d)(i), the board of trustees shall eliminate the name of one engineering
consultant from the list of engineering consultants and the name of one
accounting consultant from the list of accounting consultants and shall notify
the receiving entity, or in cases where there is no receiving entity, the
sponsors of the petition in writing of the eliminations.
(iv)  Within three days of receiving notification under Subsection (5)(d), the
receiving entity, or in cases where there is no receiving entity, the sponsors
of the petition shall eliminate another name of an engineering consultant from
the list of engineering consultants and another name of an accounting
consultant from the list of accounting consultants and shall notify the board
of trustees in writing of the eliminations.
(v)  The board of trustees and the receiving entity, or in cases where there
is no receiving entity, the board and the sponsors of the petition shall
continue to alternate between them, each eliminating the name of one
engineering consultant from the list of engineering consultants and the name
of one accounting consultant from the list of accounting consultants and
providing written notification of the eliminations within three days of
receiving notification of the previous notification, until the name of only
one engineering consultant remains on the list of engineering consultants and
the name of only one accounting consultant remains on the list of accounting
consultants.
(e)  The requirement under Subsection (5)(b) to engage engineering and
accounting consultants does not apply if the board of trustees and the
receiving entity, or in cases where there is no receiving entity, the board
and the sponsors of the petition agree on the allocations that are the
engineering consultant's responsibility under Subsection (5)(f) or the
determinations that are the accounting consultant's responsibility under
Subsection (5)(h); provided however, that if engineering and accounting
consultants are engaged, the district and the receiving entity, or in cases
where there is no receiving entity, the district and the sponsors of the
petition shall equally share the cost of the engineering and accounting
consultants.
(f) (i)  The engineering consultant shall allocate the district assets between
the district and the receiving entity as provided in this Subsection (5)(f).
(ii)  The engineering consultant shall allocate:
(A)  to the district those assets reasonably needed by the district to provide
to the area of the district remaining after withdrawal the kind, level, and
quality of service that was provided before withdrawal; and
(B)  to the receiving entity those assets reasonably needed by the receiving
entity to provide to the withdrawn area the kind and quality of service that
was provided before withdrawal.
(iii)  If the engineering consultant determines that both the local district
and the receiving entity reasonably need a district asset to provide to their
respective areas the kind and quality of service provided before withdrawal,
the engineering consultant shall:
(A)  allocate the asset between the local district and the receiving entity
according to their relative needs, if the asset is reasonably susceptible of
division; or
(B)  allocate the asset to the local district, if the asset is not reasonably
susceptible of division.
(g)  All district assets remaining after application of Subsection (5)(f)
shall be allocated to the local district.
(h) (i)  The accounting consultant shall determine the withdrawn area's
proportionate share of any redemption premium and the principal of and
interest on:
(A)  the local district's revenue bonds that were outstanding at the time the
petition was filed;
(B)  the local district's general obligation bonds that were outstanding at
the time the petition was filed; and
(C)  the local district's general obligation bonds that:
(I)  were outstanding at the time the petition was filed; and
(II)  are treated as revenue bonds under Subsection (5)(i); and
(D)  the district's bonds that were issued prior to the date the petition was
filed to refund the district's revenue bonds, general obligation bonds, or
general obligation bonds treated as revenue bonds.
(ii)  For purposes of Subsection (5)(h)(i), the withdrawn area's proportionate
share of redemption premium, principal, and interest shall be the amount that
bears the same relationship to the total redemption premium, principal, and
interest for the entire district that the average annual gross revenues from
the withdrawn area during the three most recent complete fiscal years before
the filing of the petition bears to the average annual gross revenues from the
entire district for the same period.
(i)  For purposes of Subsection (5)(h)(i), a district general obligation bond
shall be treated as a revenue bond if:
(i)  the bond is outstanding on the date the petition was filed; and
(ii)  the principal of and interest on the bond, as of the date the petition
was filed, had been paid entirely from local district revenues and not from a
levy of ad valorem tax.
(j) (i)  Before the board of trustees of the local district files a resolution
approving a withdrawal, the receiving entity, or in cases where there is no
receiving entity, the sponsors of the petition shall irrevocably deposit
government obligations, as defined in Subsection 11-27-2(6), into an escrow
trust fund the principal of and interest on which are sufficient to provide
for the timely payment of the amount determined by the accounting consultant
under Subsection (5)(h) or in an amount mutually agreeable to the board of
trustees of the local district and the receiving entity, or in cases where
there is no receiving entity, the board and the sponsors of the petition.
Notwithstanding Subsection 17B-1-512(1), the board of trustees shall not be
required to file a resolution approving a withdrawal until the requirements
for establishing and funding an escrow trust fund in this Subsection (5)(j)(i)
have been met; provided that, if the escrow trust fund has not been
established and funded within 180 days after the board of trustees passes a
resolution approving a withdrawal, the resolution approving the withdrawal
shall be void.
(ii)  Concurrently with the creation of the escrow, the receiving entity, or
in cases where there is no receiving entity, the sponsors of the petition
shall provide to the board of trustees of the local district:
(A)  a written opinion of an attorney experienced in the tax-exempt status of
municipal bonds stating that the establishment and use of the escrow to pay
the proportionate share of the district's outstanding revenue bonds and
general obligation bonds that are treated as revenue bonds will not adversely
affect the tax-exempt status of the bonds; and
(B)  a written opinion of an independent certified public accountant verifying
that the principal of and interest on the deposited government obligations are
sufficient to provide for the payment of the withdrawn area's proportionate
share of the bonds as provided in Subsection (5)(h).
(iii)  The receiving entity, or in cases where there is no receiving entity,
the sponsors of the petition shall bear all expenses of the escrow and the
redemption of the bonds.
(iv)  The receiving entity may issue bonds under Title 11, Chapter 14, Local
Government Bonding Act, and Title 11, Chapter 27, Utah Refunding Bond Act, to
fund the escrow.
(6)  A requirement imposed by the board of trustees as a condition to
withdrawal under Subsection (5) shall, in addition to being expressed in the
resolution, be reduced to a duly authorized and executed written agreement
between the parties to the withdrawal.
(7)  An area that is the subject of a withdrawal petition under Section
17B-1-504 that results in a board of trustees resolution denying the proposed
withdrawal may not be the subject of another withdrawal petition under Section
17B-1-504 for two years after the date of the board of trustees resolution
denying the withdrawal.
