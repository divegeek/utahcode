17B-2a-509.   State engineer not prohibited from increasing water allotment.
Nothing in this part may be construed to prohibit the state engineer, upon
petition by an irrigation district board of trustees, from increasing the
maximum allotment of water for one or more tracts of land within the district
if the state engineer determines that the land cannot be beneficially
irrigated with the currently allotted water.
