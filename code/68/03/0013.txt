68-3-13.   Printing boldface in numbered bills -- Purpose -- Effect -- Power
of Office of Legislative Research and General Counsel to change.
A short summary of each section, part, chapter, or title, called boldface, may
be printed in numbered bills introduced in the Legislature.  This boldface is
not law; it is intended only to highlight the content of each section, part,
chapter, or title for legislators.  Inaccurate boldface is not a basis for
invalidating legislation.  The Office of Legislative Research and General
Counsel is authorized in Section 36-12-12 to change the boldface in the
enrolling process so that it more accurately reflects the substance of each
section, part, chapter, or title.
