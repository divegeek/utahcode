15-7-6.   Signatures of officers.

(1) Any certificated registered public obligation is valid and binding, notwithstanding the fact that any authorized officer who signed it ceased to be an authorized officer before it is issued.

(2)  An authorized officer may adopt as and for the signature of such officer the signature of a predecessor in office if that predecessor's signature appears on the certificated registered public obligation. An authorized officer incurs no liability by adoption of a predecessor's signature that would not be incurred by such authorized officer if the signature were that of such authorized officer.



Enacted by Chapter 62, 1983 General Session
