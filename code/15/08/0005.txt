15-8-5.   General requirements of disclosure.

(1)  A lessor shall disclose to a consumer the information required by this chapter.  In a transaction involving more than one lessor, only one lessor needs to make the disclosures, but all lessors shall be bound by the disclosures.

(2)  The disclosures shall be made at or before consummation of the rental purchase agreement.

(3)  The disclosures shall be made clearly and conspicuously in writing and a copy of the rental purchase agreement shall be provided to the consumer at consummation or at some specified time after consummation, with consent of the consumer.  The disclosures required under Subsection 15-8-6(1) shall be made on the face of the contract, above the line provided for the consumer's signature.

(4)  If a disclosure becomes inaccurate as the result of any act, occurrence, or agreement by the consumer after delivery of the required disclosures, the resulting inaccuracy is not a violation of this chapter.
