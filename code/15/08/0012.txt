15-8-12.   Lessor's defenses.

(1)  If a lessor established by a preponderance of evidence that a violation of this chapter is unintentional or the result of a bona fide error, no penalty specified in Section 15-8-11 may be imposed and the validity of the transaction is not affected.

(2)  A lessor has no liability under this part for any failure to comply with any requirement imposed under this chapter if, within 60 days after discovering an error, and prior to the institution of an action under this chapter or the receipt of written notice of the error from the consumer, the lessor notifies the affected consumer of the error and makes whatever adjustments in the consumer's account as are necessary to correct the error.

(3)  A penalty does not apply if any action is performed or omitted in good faith and in conformity with any provision of this chapter, notwithstanding that after an action or omission has occurred, the provision of the chapter is, for any reason, amended, rescinded, or determined by judicial or other competent authority to be invalid.
